In a photo of such a scene the bright areas look washed out and everything in shadows is pictured as a black spot with no details. The HDR technique allows you to capture details in bright and dark areas and have them merged in a single photo.  HDR photography is widely adopted by professional photographers. Wouldn't it be nice to have an HDR in mobile phones?  The problem is that HDR requires taking several differently exposed images in series, which must be precisely aligned and then fused. In order to be usable for real life scenes, the HDR feature should include moving object detection and hand shake compensation to avoid or minimize the ghosting in the final image. That requires a lot of computational resources and makes a challenge even for professional desktop HDR software.  Almalence has brought its expertise in professional HDR software to mobile phones. Our HDR fusion algorithms compensate hand shaking and detect moving objects in the scene, suppressing ghosting artifacts. At the same time, the algorithms are quick enough to provide comfortable processing time on mobile devices.

NONE;Funny Fart: This is an application to create funny jokes and hilarious situations.  With this application you will be able to joke farts ringing your phone. Only select an option from the combo and wave your mobile device.   History of Farts:  Farts are thought to have originated in the time before mass evolution when every life form was a small microbe. Farts were used a boost application to escape predators, which then evolved into a natural repellent. Then, a few young males needing something to occupy their time while hunting later pioneered its evolution just because they found it entertaining, and passed the art down to every generation of boys since by anal tradition. Farting was even a rite of passage for many in the ancient world, a boy might have to prove himself by out-farting the older males of his tribe. Aristotle was the first to insist that  fart logic  is the only logic undeniably true, and indeed:  He who denied it, supplied it.  Later, Descartes based his fundamental ontology on the phrase:  I fart, therefore I am.   Along side it's historical use as weaponry at war, Fartium also was an early free form anaesthetic well known to the Continental European Tribes although considered uncivilized by the Greeks and Romans who preferred to just throw the sick to the lions. Then for the longest time it was considered vulgar.  In the 20th century, the fart joke was reestablished as the main medium for experiencing a fart. Gone were the days of seeing it as a noble art. Despite this, direct facial Fartium exposure rose to prominent as a form of torture, and became known as giving someone a helping of  beef-stew.  This would have been seen as barbaric in earlier ages, but in the context of the post-modern period, the etiquette of planting one's butt in the face of another and ripping a fart was literally blown out the window. The feminist movement started as a reaction to this practice, which was normally perpetrated by males onto their little sisters--little brothers, as everyone knows, enjoy being farted on.  In the 21st century, Apple is currently creating an amazing product, the  iFart . It will allow you to fart into a microphone, and the frequency of your fart will cause your music player to choose the song your fart wants to hear most. It has been rumored that Microsoft, in response, is working to develop  eFarts,  which will allow a user to attach a fart to an email and send it to another user. The incorporation of farting into the Wii and social media shows us that farts will probably become more and more digitized. We may even cease needing males to produce them.  
GAME;This app is now optimized for both phones and tablets. Keep your preschoolers occupied while they gain and improve their number and letter recognition skills with Kids Connect the Dots, the acclaimed digital version of the classic game.   Millions of children have already enjoyed the friendly themes, bright illustrations, and encouraging vocal cues of its lite version. While the free version contains 25 puzzles, this paid app features more than a 100 simple connect-the-dot puzzles and promises to keep your little one enthralled.  Choosing the play button immediately begins a connect-the-dot adventure. With a preschool-friendly interface, the app is simple enough for your child to play without any help. The dots may be customized to display upper or lower case alphabet letters, and odd or even numbers. The child can connect the dots by either finger-drag drawing or single tapping from dot-to-dot. As he or she progresses, the next dot lights up. This hint command may be controlled to occur immediately or after the screen has been idle for three seconds.  When children succeed in connecting all of the dots, the outline is delightfully transformed into a colorful graphic. It might be a bird or muffin, a giraffe or a treasure chest. Preschoolers are surprised and filled with wonder to see the creatures and objects they have created  come to life .  Parents can emphasize the importance of following a sequence by activating the app's audio cues. When the audio mode is selected, a pleasing narrator guides your preschooler through the activity, naming each letter or number he touches. The narrator also gives your budding genius an upbeat affirmation before the child moves on to the next puzzle.  The images that appear when your child completes a picture are not always easy to guess. This lends an element of mystery to the activity, developing your preschooler?Î∏s imagination and love of learning.

With Kids ABC Letters, your preschool-aged kids will learn the alphabet letter names and will practice letter shapes, letter recognition, and finding letters in context.  ?ˆê What won't my children learn? Kids ABC Letters does not teach your kids the phonetic sounds that the alphabet letters actually make.   Knowing how the alphabet letters are pronounced is a separate educational goal, which is covered in a separate app, called Kids ABC Phonics. Including it in Kids ABC Letters would detract from the focus of this game and make it too complex to invite and delight children.  To sum it up, Kids ABC Letters is about the names of the letters, while Kids ABC Phonics is about the sounds of the letters.  ?ˆê What activities are included in this game? The game has four wonderfully child-friendly sections.  ?“‡ Naming Letters. A delightfully distraction-free way for kids to learn the name and the appearance of each ABC alphabet letter. Kids can tap on the letters to verify that they?Î∏ve learned the names correctly.  ?“‡ Forming Letters. Kids get to practice remembering what the letters look like by sliding colorful puzzle pieces into place that make up the shapes of the letters.  ?“‡ Recognizing Letters. Children get to play a fun game where they help the cat catch fish with alphabet letters on their sides as they swim by. By the time kids are done, they know the appearance and pronunciation of the letters by heart.  ?“‡ Identifying Letters in Context. This simple educational game teaches kids to recognize alphabet letters as they appear in words. As a result, preschoolers learn that words are made up of letters.   ?ˆê Hey, how did you take the top spots in the Education section?  ?“‡ Kids love our games. Parents love to see their preschool-aged children being both educated and quietly happy.

DOCUMENT_EDITOR;"New feature: Lock single picture. So you can show people any single picture without worrying people scrolling through your picture album. To do so, just view the picture and then click menu-&gt;Lock, and then you can hand over your device to your friends without worrying. ======================================  With PhotoVault, privacy is no longer an issue. You can show your photo gallery to all the friends, family, and strangers on the bus that you want because the embarrassing, the secret, the private photos are all hidden from view, tucked away in your Private gallery. In fact, when in Public mode, those hidden photos aren't even part of your photo gallery--their very existence is hidden. And more than just hidden from other people, they're hidden from other apps.  You can even set PhotoVault itself to open in Public mode, so it appears just like a standard photo gallery to any who might pick up your Android or be looking over your shoulder. Until, that is, you enter the password.  You, of course, have complete access to the photos in your Private gallery. You can manipulate them; share them via e-mail, messaging, Facebook, and other social networks; give a slide show; and more. You can do anything with them that you can with those in the Public gallery. The photos are easily transferred from Public gallery to Private gallery and back again with just a long-click on the photo's thumbnail.  If you ever have any questions on how it all works, there are instructions in the app and links to online support and FAQs. Best yet, the developer is actively working on PhotoVault, adding new features and taking requests.  Never be nervous about the privacy of the photos on your Android again with PhotoVault installed.  It is best in this category. The key features are: - Hidden Mode (hide app icon) feature. - Simple hide/unhide one picture at a time by long hold on the picture thumbnail. - Multi-select to hide/unhide group of pictures - Multi-select to delete group of pictures - Simple hide/unhide a whole folder of pictures by long hold on the folder - View single picture in full size on both public and private side. - Slideshows on both public and private side - Share picture on both public and private side - Organize private pictures into different folders.  - Create your own private folders. - Set app into Public mode, which disguise the app as a regular gallery, no private pictures showing. And no password is asked till click on menu-&gt; Change Mode  to enter password to enable all features  There is no other app on the Market can do all of these.   Remember to visit our website to find more tips and tricks.  If you like this app, please do leave us a positive feedback at the Market.  Want to hide videos, checkout VideoVault.

I've tried almost all of the tablet texting apps and I like this one the best! Most important to me is that It's private and secure - it doesn't use some third party company/website where my conversations are stored, all my texts are between the recipient and myself like they should be.

NONE;"This is the professional version of DaTuner Chromatic Tuner, reviewed on Android Central:  For the Android-loving musician, I think DaTuner Pro is easily the best tuner you can have on your device. I used to give that title to *see review!*, but DaTuner has proven to be so powerful, easy to use, and accurate, it'd be foolish to not use it.   http://www.androidcentral.com/android-app-review-tuner-datuner-pro  DaTuner is an all-purpose chromatic tuner with a simple interface. DaTuner converts the fundamental frequency to the nearest note and error in cents for quick and easy tuning of your guitar, ukelele, violin, bass, cello, mandolin, piano, harp, saxophone, balafone, Ducati timing belt, harmonica, kazoo, you name it.  1.) No dead zone - screen changes to green when tuning is good. 2.) Auto-Sensitivity - no configuration required. 3.) Bright, easy-to-read display. 4.) Quick, accurate and precise. &lt; 0.3 cents @ E3 (329.62Hz), &lt;0.1 cents @ C5(1046.5Hz), &lt; 1 cent @ A2 (110Hz) 5.) Screen lock: Lock to the note you want to tune, even if extremely out of tune and make your way up/down to it. 6.) Filter lock: Lock and filter to a specific note and filter out everything outside that note's range. 7.) Ad-free! 8.) Reference frequency adjustment for orchestra tuning. 9.) Choice of colours for sharp/flat 10.) Transposition. 11.) Temperaments. You can modify the ones that exist or add your own using a text editor. The temperaments are saved on your external memory under the /DaTuner directory. 12.) Notation (ie Solf∑?ge, English, English sharp, English flat, Northern European.) Customization of these will be possible in a future upgrade. 13.) Emulated strobe tuner display 14.) Digital display of error in cents 15.) Pitch pipe (triangle, sine, sawtooth, square) 16.) Pitch pipe auto mode (no touch!) 17.) Accelerated tuning algorithm. 18.) Sample rate range 8kHz - 48kHz.  DaTuner's display is easy to read; nearest note and octave is displayed in a giant, easy to read font in the center of the screen, and frequency in hertz plus error in cents is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Sensitivity is auto-adjusted, but can also be adjusted by touch via a bar on the left-hand side of the screen, and the speed/accuracy of the algorithm and the relative frequency (if other than 440Hz) can be adjusted via the configuration menu.  There is no  dead zone  with this tuner app as is the case with many other apps. Instead, the whole display turns green when the incoming frequency is within a configurable range of the target frequency and you can still see small changes in pitch even within the  in-range  area. Both the  in-tune  range and the colours shown for sharp and flat can be configured in this version. The emulated strobe tuner display provides additional visual feedback to how close to the desired note you are.   Screen lock and filter lock allow you to select the note that you would like to tune to, with filter lock ignoring anything outside of the range of the note you wish to tune, which is useful for tuning in noisy environs.  I have tried my best to eliminate bugs from this software, and I apologize in advance for any problems you might find. Getting feedback via email, negative and positive, is very appreciated, so please email me all of the problems that occur so I can fix them! Try out the free version of DaTuner first to be sure that you want to buy the  pro  version.  BUGS:  - Doesn't detect any notes  Turn on mic auto-adjust! Ensure that the signal rises above the little yellow triangle - the algorithm doesn't run until this level is exceeded! If using auto-adjust, stop playing for a moment occasionally to allow the auto-adjust to re-sample the background noise.  "

How do I move them? A: We recommend using the pinch gesture to zoom in to the desired key point to make it very clear exactly which point you?Î∏re trying to move. When the whole image fits in the screen, the key points can be very close together and difficult to individually select. Second, you need to tap and hold the key point for a couple seconds until the magnifier appears just above your finger. The appearance of the magnifier means you have the key point properly selected. If you tap too quickly and pull your finger away from the screen, the key point will not be selected. Also, if you tap and hold, but don?Î∏t see the magnifier appear, you may find that you have the image selected and it will scroll the image if you move your finger. You ?Î“missed?Îú selecting the key point?Î‡try tapping on it again.  Q: I have a picture with a face in it that says no face was detected. What happened? A: Generally, the problem is with the source image. These are the most common reasons: 1. Subject should face directly at camera. 2. Use a high resolution photo. 3. Ensure the face is the primary region of focus. 4. Make sure to have sufficient lighting. 5. Make sure the face is large enough. If it?Î∏s too small, there?Î∏s may not be enough detail to work with. If you think that none of these apply to your picture, we?Î∏d be happy to take a look at it and see if our face detection algorithms can be improved to support it. Contact us at android@arcsoft.com and attach the problem picture.

Developing the new time theory enabled controlling its existing form. The world has changed thanks to that! Machines which slow down the time are a permanent element of the human life.   In 2026, just after establishing the EIA (Earth Interplanetary Alliance) and determining the space law, people started to make regular trips into space. Thanks to the minerals obtained during the explorations of other planets, the technological development continues to pick up pace. 15 years later, at the beginning of 2036 after intercepting an unusual signal from an unknown civilization, the EIA Ministry assigned all its financial and logistic resources in order to make another contact..  Unfortunately, the Xelorians turned out to be uninterested in the diplomatic contact with humans and the only activity which they were willing to take towards human beings was to begin military action.  The First Contact War began in 2037.  Thanks to the diversifying actions we found out that the foreign race, the Xelorians as they would call themselves, had expansive intentions.  After a biophysical analysis of a captured alive Xelorian, our scientists found out that the destructive genes in those species were assimilated in their DNA artificially, thus we can be certain there is something of the very unknown and unimaginable to the human race behind the invasion.   However, the foreign race committed a huge mistake. They have misestimated their chances not knowing what the humans are capable of. Although the human civilization is coming to a destruction point, people have come together as never before.   Physicists have discovered the source of supply of the foreign units. They are the crystals of Xelors which in most cases are undamaged during destruction. The physicists have developed provisional mechanisms which can reinforce the kinetic properties of specific weapons when implemented into them.  You are an airman of a standard EIA hybrid unit of the 5th generation.  Current aim: resist and prevent the attack on Earth   If you like games like Radiant, Tyrian, AirAttack, 1942, 1943, Siberian Strike, iFighter, Air Strike, Flying Shark, DoDonPachi, R-Type, Gradius, Espgaluda, Swiv, Sky Force, Asteroids, Shogun, Bullet Shooter, Warblade,Sector Strike,Battleray Starfighter, this game is for you.

ANDROID_TOOL;ANNOUNCEMENT: This app has a successor named SkipLock. It is similar to Unlock With WiFi, but with some major new features. If you bought Unlock With WiFi in the last two months, please contact me and I will either refund your purchase or give you a free copy of SkipLock. You don't *have* to switch to SkipLock. If you are happy with Unlock With WiFi, stick with it. It will still be supported. For a full explanation of why SkipLock was created, see this blog post: http://benhirashima.com/posts/the-rebirth-of-unlock-with-wifi/  This app is NOT the unlock key for SkipLock. Do not buy this app if you want to use SkipLock.  Tired of entering your password every time you turn on your phone? Unlock With WiFi?«Ù unlocks your phone when you're connected to your home WiFi network. When you're at home, or work, you don't need to worry about losing your phone, so why should you have to enter your password?  Unlock With WiFi is the leading password convenience app on the market. It's focus is on reliability, quality, and a great user experience. The setup wizard makes it easy to setup, and helpful dialogs are displayed if something isn't quite right.  How it works:  When you get home and connect to your WiFi network, your device will unlock. Then when you leave, and the WiFi disconnects, the device will lock again. You have to enter your password the first time after you connect to your WiFi network. This is so that if someone steals or finds your phone, they can't just bring it to your house to unlock it. After you enter your password once while connected to your WiFi network, you won't have to enter it again until you leave/disconnect. This is great for SMS texting!  Additional Features:  You can also set a lock delay, for when you're not at home. The default delay is set to 5 seconds (you can adjust it), so when you turn the screen off, the device won't lock until 5 seconds have passed. That way, if you remember something you forgot to do, you can turn it back on without entering your password. This feature is considered experimental at this time. It works on most devices, but isn't guaranteed to work on all devices.  There are also battery saving options to:  Turn off WiFi when you leave home Turn on Bluetooth when you leave home Turn off Bluetooth when you get home Turn off Auto Sync when you leave home Turn on Auto Sync when you get home WidgetLocker integration   If you have trouble with this app, please email me. Don't give me a bad review until I have a chance to help you get it working! Send an email with Unlock With WiFi in the subject to unlockwithwifi@benhirashima.com. If it doesn't have Unlock With WiFi in the subject, it will be filtered as spam.  IMPORTANT: To uninstall this app, you must select Uninstall from the menu inside the app. The normal way won't work if device admin mode is enabled.  WARNING: This app doesn't work on some phones. Please read this description carefully, and the FAQ. http://benhirashima.com/unlockwithwifi/faq  Known Limitations:  The app is not compatible with Motorola Skip or Dots. Do not install this app on the SD card. It will not be secure if you do. It won't work on phones that have full device encryption enabled. It won't work if your employer enforces a password policy on your phone. Some corporate Exchange email users have this. Only PINs and passwords can be used in Android 4.0 and above. Patterns and face unlock are not supported.  Unlock With WiFi is incompatible with some antivirus and battery saver apps. See the FAQ for details.

ANDROID_TOOL;"Link2SD is an application manager that makes it easy for Android 2.0+ users to move applications to the SD card, to clean all cache files of the apps. It enables you to manage your apps and storage easily. It also provides native app to SD (app2sd) features on Android 2.2 and higher. It can move any non-protected user apps to SD card (force move), with batch moving capability. That feature uses Android's standard SD-card installation feature and does not require a second partition.  Cache cleaner function clears all your cache and free up space with a single tap. Also cache cleaner widget displays total cache size and enables  one tap cache cleaning  without opening the app.  Features: - App manager - Create and remove link for apk, dex and lib files of the app.  - Plus version also links private data files of the apps - Automatically link newly installed apps (optional) - Move any user apps to SD even though the app does not support moving to SD (a.k.a.  force move , for Android 2.2 and higher) - Shows the apps that support moving to SD with native apps2sd  - Set the default install location of the apps; auto, internal, or external  - Batch link, unlink, reinstall, uninstall,  move to SD ,  move to phone  functions  - Notify when movable apps installed  - Uninstall system applications (bloatware removal)  - Freeze and un-freeze system and users applications  - Convert system apps into user apps  - Convert user apps into system apps  - Integrate  Updated  system apps into system (ROM)  - Clear data and cache of the application  - Clear all apps cache at once (1-tap cache cleaner without being root) - Exclusion list for  Clear all app cache  function - Clear cache widget (1-tap cache cleaner without being root)  - Notify if total cache size exceeds specified size  - List applications, show detailed size information and link status  - Wide variety of options to sort and filter apps  - Search applications by name  - Display available space information of internal storage, SD card and SD card 2nd partition  - Share the link of an app - Support 35+ languages  Plus features: - Links internal data directories of the apps to SD card - Links dex files of the system apps to SD card - Auto clear cache service - Removes ads from Link2SD  What you need for linking apps: - root permission.  - a second partition on your SD card.   You should have two partitions on SD card and both should be primary. The first FAT partition is your standard SD card storage. The second partition is used for application files and can be ext2, ext3, ext4, f2fs or FAT.  You need to use a non-FAT file system (ext2, ext3, ext4 or f2fs) on your second partition in order to link app's private data files. Because the FAT file system (FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT) does not support UNIX file ownership or permissions and will cause a security breakdown of app's private files. Link2SD Plus can move app's private data files if you have a non-FAT partition  Link2SD does not create the second partition, you need to create it yourself. You can use any partition manager such as Minitool, Paragon, Easeus etc. for this.   When you connect your phone to PC as mass storage, Android unmounts the first FAT partition but the second partition remains mounted. Therefore linked applications are not affected and can be run without problems.  Link2SD is free (ad supported) application.  DISCLAIMER: It is made available for use at your own risk with no warranty of any kind.  "

Below is a description of required permissions:   INTERNET ACCESS - To check/download updates (for non-Market users), free upgrades via GetJar Rewards, ad on startup  VIEW NETWORK STATE - Solo checks if internet connection is up and enables/disables online features as appropriate  READ PHONE STATE AND IDENTITY (Solo Lite Only) - Only used to access the device ID. Solo does NOT access phone calls, etc. only the device ID (needed to uniquely identify the device and earn gold to upgrade features)  The  Read phone state and identity  permission doesn't give devs access to passwords or other personal identity information. The only id obtained from this is the phone's IMEI number, which is a unique serial number tied to every device with a sim card. Knowing this number does not give devs access to any personal information, it only provides a way for us to reliably distinguish between different devices.  GET_ACCOUNTS (Solo Lite only) - This is used by GetJar and Pocket Change to identify users across multiple devices. This way, features upgraded through GetJar, or rewards earned through Pocket Change, will still be available if you change your phone and reinstall the app on a new device. Without this, upgrades purchased would only be available on the device where the original purchase was made.  GET_TASKS (Solo Lite only) - Used to determine if a sponsored app (installed to earn free GetJar gold) has been opened so that the gold can be awarded to you and be used to upgrade features.  STORAGE - Used to backup/restore chords on the SD Card  VIBRATE - For string vibrations and haptic feedback (optional)

NFC is required to support Android Beam and INTERNET is required for the Facebook, Twitter and YouTube integration.   VIDEO FAQ:  ?„ç How can I play Paper Camera videos on my PC?  Using any WebM player. We recommend Firefox or Chrome, however you might be able to use Windows Media Player or Internet Explorer if you install the right plugins.   ?„ç I can't play Paper Camera videos on my standard device gallery.  You require Android 4.0 or higher for this to work, on older versions you can use the in-app video player.  ?„ç I can't record video with Paper Camera on my new device, why?  We've only enabled this feature on devices that we know can support it properly. However you can still try using unofficial video recording support.  ?„ç How do I enable unofficial video recording support?  In the settings menu. Let us know if this works properly on your device and we will officially enable it in future versions. Please note that you will have to be running Android 2.3.3 and have support for NEON instructions for this to work at all.  ?„ç I've unlocked unofficial video support but I cannot playback my videos in Paper Camera, why?  This is a known limitation on some devices, there are 3 workarounds for this:  - You can playback videos on your PC. - You can use MX Video Player, if you enable software mode.  - Hopefully when your device will receive a 4.0 upgrade this issue will be fixed.

USE_INTERNET;*** Please read all instructions carefully. *** Not all devices are supported, therefore it is strongly recommended that you try the 'Sixaxis Compatibility Checker' (available for free in the Android Market) before purchasing this app.  Finally the wait is over... The ultimate gaming experience awaits! Now you can play games on your phone the way they were meant to be played! Sixaxis Controller allows you to use your PS3 Sixaxis, DualShock 3 and Navigation controllers in many of your favourite games and applications.  *** IMPORTANT *** - ROOT access is required!!! - Due to the way pairing is done with the controllers, you need to manually pair your controller with the PC utility 'SixaxisPairTool' (available on the website) and a mini-USB cable. Android 3.1+ users can also pair directly on their devices via USB. - It is highly recommended that you use an ORIGINAL controller. Many after market controllers will not work with this app. If you get a 'Client connected: 1' message, but the lights on your controller continue to flash, it is almost certainly not an original Sony controller. - The fake controllers that are most likely to work (though not guaranteed) are those made by Gasia. If you bought a fake that works but isn't made by Gasia, I'd love to hear from you so I can compile a list of known working controllers. - Be sure to read the instructions in the help menu carefully.  Features: - Up to four Sixaxis, DualShock 3 and Navigation controllers supported at once. - Support as a native gamepad in Android 3.1+ devices. Full support for analog sticks and analog triggers. - Keyboard emulation. Map all buttons and sticks to almost any key available in Android. - Mouse emulation. Configure a button to activate the mouse pointer on devices that support mice (most tablets, and many phones should work). - Touch emulation allows you to map buttons and analog sticks to the screen. Play all your favourite games with full analog support, even those without built-in controller support!

ANDROID_TOOL;"BatteryBot is the original battery indicator app for Android, released in 2009 as simply  Battery Indicator . Both the free and the Pro versions have maintained a 4.5+ star rating in Google Play from the beginning. It offers two modes: the original status bar indicator and now also a desktop widget. You can use either or both, as you please. For those who want more than is offered in the free version, or for those who just like to support small, independent developers like me, this Pro version remains lightweight while packing in many useful features:  BatteryBot Pro monitors and shows your battery charge level (percent) as an icon in your status bar, with temperature, health, voltage, and time since plugged / unplugged in the notification area. It also has user-configurable alarms, logs, and widgets.  Features: ?ÎÙ Automatic time-remaining estimates based on recent usage ?ÎÙ Several icon sets (including fully configurable green, amber, red, and black icons) ?ÎÙ Small (1x1) and large (4x1) app widgets ?ÎÙ Notification (with status bar icon) is now optional -- can be used as just a desktop widget ?ÎÙ Battery logging. You can log the battery state (charge, status, voltage, temperature) and browse the logs on the phone or export to CSV. ?ÎÙ Manually or automatically disable / reenable device lock screen / lockscreen / keyguard ?ÎÙ Alarms (full, charge above X, charge below X, temperature above X, or health failure) ?ÎÙ Control the notification priority on Android 4.1+ (For example, you can set to  minimum  to hide the icon but keep the notification in the tray.) ?ÎÙ Lots of configurability of behavior and appearance. ?ÎÙ The charging indicator (the bolt under the number that indicates when the device is being charged) for the sets that have it is optional in the Pro version. ?ÎÙ Very lightweight (please email me if you think otherwise, and I'll help you figure out what's wrong ?Î‡ I promise this app will not drain your battery!) ?ÎÙ Shows 1% increments even on most Motorola devices (option needs to be enabled on devices that default to 10% increments) ?ÎÙ Well-tested and supported on all major versions of Android (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2; Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich / ICS, Jelly Bean) and form factors (small phones, medium phones, large phones, 7-inch tablets, 10-inch tablets). ?ÎÙ Open source  ~~~~  A one-time purchase now gets you free updates for life on all your Android devices.  ~~~~  All requested app permissions are explained on the project website.  ~~~~  Please email me if you have any questions or comments.  ~~~~  If you wish to help beta-test new releases, there's now a Google+ community for that.  BatteryBot Pro Beta Testers  https://plus.google.com/communities/108365502089038835850  ~~~~  Here's the BatteryBot business model / philosophy:  1) Ads are annoying. For some apps, ads might make sense, but a system utility should not have ads.  2) The free version should be simple but useful; it shouldn't feel crippled.  3) Some people choose to purchase the Pro version because they want extra features, some because they want more customization, and many because they just want to say  thanks  for the free version and support small, independent developers like myself.

FLASHLIGHT;"This app contains a set of tiny tools: a flashlight, a unit converter, a timer, a stopwatch, a compass a bubble level, a calculator, a magnifying glass (Android 2.2+ required), a mirror (Android 2.3+ and front camera required) and a ruler. Each tool does what it is supposed to do. There's no space for special effects like 3D compass, talking level, psychedelic flashlight etc: the goal is to have a lightweight, fast and easy to use set of tools, one  tap  away from your home screen. This app is half the size of a common  standalone tool  like a compass, a flashlight or a magnifying glass. This way you'll save a lot of disk space. You'll save network consumption too, not only for the first download but for every update too. It doesn't require network access, the permission to write on your flash memory or the permission to read your contacts.  Suggestions, like new features to implement, new tools etc. are welcome. If you want to contribute a translation, please let us know by sending us an email ;)  If you find a bug, please contact us using the  Report a bug  main menu function. Note: if you write a comment on the Android Market without sending us an email, it's difficult for us to fix the problem, because usually we need some information (such as smartphone type and version, a way to replicate the problem, etc.).   Note: - Depending on the hardware capabilities of your device, some tools may not be shown - The permission to use the camera is required in order to turn on the camera flash LED. Some devices (for instance the Google Nexus S) don't light the flash LED if the camera is not running. If you check the most popular flashlight apps, you'll find out that they all require this permission. Swiss Army Knife doesn't shoot any photos, doesn't save multimedia info onto the flash card and doesn't send anything via the internet: it doesn't require network permissions at all.  "

WALLPAPER;With over 1,000 icons in 176 different styles/colors, you can break the monotony of traditional themes and icon packs. For the price of a latte, you can theme all your Android devices exactly how you want them for the rest of your life. Visit me on Google+ to talk about Droidicon: http://gplus.to/Droidicon  In the early days of LauncherPro, there were only a handful of dock icons included in that beautiful and unique LP style we have come to know and love. To find more icons in that style, you had to search the web and read through 50 page forum posts. Then you had to download them to your sd card and apply them from there. The same was true of dock backgrounds.   Then, in June 2010, I brought something new to the LauncherPro icon and dock game. I built launcherproicons.com where artists could upload their icons and docks, and people could easily find them and download them as well as make requests for new icons.   This still had the problem of downloading to the sd card first, then finding them and applying them. I fixed that problem by developing the Droidicon app.   This app bypasses all the mess of searching for icons on the web, and groups over 1,000 icons and 400 docks into one app. When you go to choose a new custom icon, you simply open Droidicon, and start typing the name of the app you are trying to find. The giant list of icons will be filtered down, and you can quickly choose the icon you need. You can also search through the docks.  I decided to take it one step further and add over 170 different styles of icons. Each icon is available in each style in a broad range of colors. You can switch styles at any time, and even build sleek home screens that use multiple icon styles for some really beautiful effects. With this addition, Droidicon transcended LauncherPro, and became valuable to users of ADW Launcher, GO Launcher and the rest of the home screen replacements.  If you are looking for a way to escape completely uniform ADW and LauncherPro icon packs and boring stock home screens to theme your phone exactly how you want it, you absolutely need this app. It is the ultimate tool for personalization.  For a few examples of home screens made with our icons and docks visit http://launcherproicons.com/screenshots  Help me improve the app by telling me what you would like to see at http://droidicon.uservoice.com/  The icons can be used out of the box with the following applications: * ADW and ADW EX * Open Home * GO Launcher EX  * LauncherPro and LauncherPro Plus  If you also install Desktop VisualizeR or BetterCut, the icons will work with: * Zeam * HTC SenseUI * Android 2.3 Launcher * Launch-X * Any other launcher  The docks can only be used with launchers that support changing the dock background.  Some of the artwork in this app is free to download at http://bit.ly/lpicons.

USE_INTERNET;This service is similar to the system components that enable other forms of wireless connectivity on your phone (ie. WiFi, NFC) and will not run or use system resources unless you start an app that requires ANT wireless communication. It is pre-installed by your device manufacturer to allow the built-in ANT hardware already present in your mobile device to operate. If you do not intend to use this feature there will be no impact to your system and no further action is required. If this service is not pre-installed on your phone you may still be able to enable ANT+ communication, see http://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/ant-in-android/ for more info.  What is ANT?  ANT is an extremely power efficient wireless communication technology. ANT allows you to connect to, and make use of various other ANT or ANT+ devices. Today, this service allows you to connect to popular interoperable ANT+ sport/fitness/health devices such as heart rate sensors, fitness equipment, cycling products, weight scales and more. In the future it will be possible to use ANT to enable a myriad of new applications from your mobile device, such as home automation control of lighting, temperature and door lock functions. Visit www.thisisant.com for more info.  How to use:  This system service cannot be launched directly. It will run automatically in the background whenever any application that requires ANT wireless communication is used.  ANT+ enabled applications also typically require downloading the ANT+ Plugins http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsi.ant.plugins.antplus  Some popular apps enhanced with ANT+: * Samsung S Health * Garmin Fit?«Ù * SportsTracker by STL * Endomondo * My Tracks * Run.GPS Trainer UV * IpBike, IpWatts, IpPeloton, IpSmartHr * Selfloops * SportyPal * MapMyFITNESS/RIDE/RUN/WALK+/HIKE/DOGWALK    Developing ANT Applications:  ANT is an ultra low power wireless technology great for low data rate applications such as sensors, monitors, beacons, command and control, etc. Connecting devices and transferring data is simple using our ANT API. Developing apps for ANT+ devices is even easier using our ANT+ Plugins API. These APIs are free to use. More information is available at http://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/ant-in-android/.    Required Android Permissions:  ?ÎˆNetwork communication- Full Internet access?Î∏: The ANT Radio Service will never download or upload any data over the internet. This permission is only required because it is possible to install the ANT Radio Service on an Android Emulator (ie: for development purposes) in which case it requires access to internet sockets to communicate with an ANT USB Stick on the host Windows PC using the ANT Android Emulator Tools. This communication requires the INTERNET permission but only communicates with the local PC.   ?ÎˆSystem tools- Modify global system settings?Î∏: This allows initialization of whether ANT should be turned off or kept on when Airplane mode is entered.

One touch Drawing is a simple yet very addictive puzzle. Many people have the experience playing this kind of game. The rule is very simple. Draw given figures with only one touch. The only problem is  You cannot draw twice the same line . According to clear levels, new lines and points like below will make it difficult. 1. Line that must be passed twice. 2. One directional line. 3. Warp point. 4. Direction trigger. 5. Way trigger.  Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/onetdrawing  
GPS_NAVIGATION;Displays GPS and sensor data: position and signal strength of satellites, accuracy, speed, acceleration, altitude, bearing, pitch, roll and battery state.  Tools included: compass with magnetic and true north, leveling tool, mark or share your location and navigate back later.  Keep your GPS fast: reset it or download A-GPS data regularly for faster fixes. Visit the FAQ at: http://mobiwia.com/gpsstatus  GPS Status is 100% space proof. Try to spot the program in the video below :)  PRO features: - show/store/edit multiple waypoints and use them on the Radar for navigation. - pressure, rotation, temperature, humidity values (if supported by the device) - removed ads  KNOWN FIRMWARE ISSUES (please do not report them):  - Samsung phones: Because of a firmware bug, they may report extreme battery consumption for GPS Status even if it is not running at all (other programs using sensors are affected too). This is harmless and no power is consumed! Just ignore it and let's hope that a future firmware upgrade will fix this on your phone.  - Droid 3: The initial Droid 3 firmware does not implement the satellite status API so you will not see the satellites and the signal strength bars. The rest of the features should work properly.  - Motorola phones: On some phones, turning your phone to airplane mode will turn off the GPS receiver, too. This is a hardware limitation.  - Droid Charge: Reports 0 altitude.  - LG Optimus: The phone cannot report the satellite SNR values correctly (all signal bars will be maxed out).  - Nexus One/S: With Andoid 2.3 it cannot report NMEA sentences. This means that the DOP/HDOP/VDOP values are not available.  
NONE;This is a plugin for 'GPS Status & Toolbox' that will remove the in-app advertisements from the program and add several PRO only features. Please consider supporting the development. PRO features: - show/store/edit multiple waypoints and use them on the Radar for navigation. - pressure, rotation, temperature, humidity values (if supported by the device) - removed ads  If you do not have 'GPS Status & Toolbox' installed, visit the 'More by MobiWIA' section and install it from there.  If you like GPS Status & Toolbox, please leave a review here and share your (hopefully) good experiences.  Thank you for your support.  NOTE: To avoid polluting your launcher with redundant icons, start GPS Status using the icon for the plugin (PRO). It will start GPS Status and also will disable itself, so on next phone reboot the icon will disappear.

GAME;Get ready for a unique physics-based puzzler. ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Top Ranked on Google Play, June 2012 - #1 in USA, Germany, France and United Kingdom (casual games category 06/2012).   Those seeking a straightforward, serious cerebral challenge should look no further , score 8.8/10 (Life of Android)  Beautifully simple mechanic that leads to complex and ridiculously fun dynamics. A must buy for android. Runs beautifully even on low end devices.  Marc (User review)  In Elastic World you control weird elastic shapes in order to make a ball hit the floating star. Expand and collapse these jelly shapes and make the ball bounce in different directions and heights.  Sounds weird but is actually pretty fast to pick up. Really nice and responsive physics engine. Feels almost real. Each level gets increasingly challenging and sometimes you have to have some pretty quick reflexes as you compete against the clock.  The faster you can hit the star, the better you are ranked.   Now with Open Feint support. Share your scores with other players and climb your way to the top of the leader boards.  Really fun and addicting!  **********  Please support independent video game development! This is the result of six months of hard work (done alongside a full-time job). Please give it a good rating.  Unlike several other games, the collision detection and physics engine were made entirely from scratch. The game and the level designer contain more than 28,000 lines of source code. Take a peek under the hood and watch the demo of the level designer, available on YouTube.

ANDROID_TOOL;Set custom sms ringtones per contact easily - with personal call and SMS tones for each of your friends and contacts! Ringo Pro is a fun and powerful way to customize sms ringtones for each of your contacts. Simply pick your friends inside Ringo and pick a music ringtone or SMS tone - you'll know instantly who is texting or calling you!  Supercharge your SMS Text & Call Notifications with Ringo Pro, the leading customisation app for Android!  Ringo Pro lets you easily pick and use any MP3 music file as your ringtone - and set individual ringtones for each of your contacts and caller groups.  Ringo really powers up your SMS text message notifications too - set a different tone for each contact's messages, and control LED colors (when supported), caller or message sender voice announcing, pop-up notifications and more!  In fact, Ringo Pro allows you to customize almost every aspect of ring tone and SMS notification. If you are one of the many people who don?Î∏t notice the polite vibrating of the phone when it rings, Ringo Pro offers a much stronger vibration. Vibration patterns are aptly named: Discreet, Classic, Enthusiastic, Frenzied, and Relentless.   Ringo Pro will really shine as you start to apply its custom settings to caller groups and to individuals in your contact list. Each person can be assigned a unique ring tone, unique SMS tone, their own color of blinking LED (on phoens that support it), and a unique level of vibrate intensity. You will know instantly whether a call is from your brother, boss, or broker. One user sets a discrete ring tone and SMS tone as a default, then gives each important caller his or her unique tones.  Ringo Pro is packed full of customization options, so you can configure your incoming calls and SMS Text alerts exactly how you want them! You can even customise your tones for SMS that come from email, and for Class 0 (Flash) SMS messages.   If you are using Ringo with GO SMS Pro or Handcent, note that these apps can disable the SMS notifications for all other apps, including Ringo, which stops Ringo working. You can fix this in their settings.  In GO SMS Pro, tap Menu / Settings / Advanced tab / Notification Settings, and uncheck Notifications. Then go to Receive Settings and un-check 'Disable other message notification'.  In Handcent, Tap Menu / Settings / Application Settings. Tap 'Default Messaging Application', and choose Disable. Then turn on 'Lower priority'.

WIDGET;"Battery Widget is an elegant 1x1 widget which shows you the battery level on your home screen, with some nice animation when charging. Tapping on it will show more battery information with a shortcut to view battery use. In case you don't have enough space in your home screen, a clear battery level indicator is available on status bar so that you can see it even when you are browsing the web or sending text messages. It can be configured to show in 3 different colors to reflect high/medium/low battery levels. You can also define your own alerts, so that Battery Widget will automatically notify you about battery status changes.  Battery Widget will not drain your battery, as it does only what it needs to do. When the device is idle, it is not listening to any battery information updates from the system if there are no active alerts. If there are active alerts, it just does minimal job to check if it needs to notify you and nothing more - it does not update any visible components when the handset is not in use. With this mechanism, Battery Widget consumes only little computation power and battery.  Available in multiple languages: English, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Russian, Greek, Italian, Hungarian, Estonian, Turkish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Catalan, Dutch, Ukrainian and Romanian. Please email me if you could help me with localizing Battery Widget.  ======================== Feature Overview ======================== - Battery level indicator on status bar, showing in different colors in 3 configurable level ranges - Alerts for various battery statuses - Time information when device is plugged/unplugged - Option to disable charging animation - Option to show temperature in Fahrenheit - Various indicator icon styles  ======================== Important Notes ======================== - Make sure that Battery Widget is excluded in any task killer programs; it might fail to work properly otherwise. - Due to the limitation of the Android platform, homescreen widgets will NOT be available if Battery Widget is moved to SD card. - Some devices indicate battery level every 10% due to their kernel design (known ones are: most Motorola devices including Droid and Atrix series, Samsung Moment series). - In Android 4.0, the system may shrink and dim level indicator icons in status bar.  ======================== Instructions ======================== Please add Battery Widget to your home screen with the general methods below:  Method 1:  Press Home button followed by Menu button. Select Add -&gt; Widgets -&gt; Battery Widget. Method 2: Press Home button to show the home screen. Tap and hold your finger on any available space, select Widgets -&gt; Battery Widget.

Question: Which Android security permissions does Catan need and why? Answer: ?Î“Storage?Îú to write data to the SD or move the game data, ?Î“Network communication?Îú to download game data and access the In App Store and ?Î“system tools?Îú to check if Catan is already running to resume a game.  Question: I bought one of the expansions but after an update, reinstallation of Catan or after restoring my phone the expansion seems gone? Answer: Don?Î∏t worry; your initial purchase is already saved in your Google account. However for technical reasons you have to select ?Î“Buy?Îú again.

ANDROID_TOOL;Introducing Pro HDR Camera, the world's first real HDR app for Android! From the team that created Pro HDR for iOS, now you can automatically create stunning full-resolution HDR images with just a single tap on your Android phone. Please note that this app has been tested to work properly on Motorola, HTC and most Samsung phones. However, if you have a LG, Sony, or other device, the HDR capability may not function properly. Full functionality has been verified on the following phones: * HTC: Thunderbolt, EVO 4G, MyTouch 4G, G2, Incredible, Desire, Legend, Bravo * Motorola: Droid, Droid 2, Droid X * Samsung: Galaxy S, Epic 4G, Galaxy Nexus  Here are a few professional reviews of our iPhone app Pro HDR:   If you ever take photos using your iPhone, this app is a must-have.  - Gizmodo   Pro HDR leaps ahead of the pack... Even if you're not into HDR photography, this is one to check out.  - TUAW   Picture Perfection: Pro HDR automatically aligns and blends the images, giving you a perfectly exposed, amazing image that rivals a high-end point-and-shoot camera  - NBC Los Angeles  Thanks to Pro HDR Camera, you no longer have to choose between a blown-out sky or a hopelessly dark foreground. Bringing automatic high dynamic range photography to your Android phone for the first time ever, Pro HDR captures an image exposed for the highlights and another exposed for the shadows. It then aligns and merges the images, giving you a gorgeous HDR image up to 8 megapixels like nothing you've ever seen from such a tiny device.  Unlike fake HDR apps that merely take a single photo and reprocess it (without actually adding any new detail), Pro HDR massively extends the dynamic range of your camera and produces beautiful results that you have to see to believe. We provide a fully automatic mode, and an assisted Manual mode for those times when you wish to choose your exact exposures. Finally, you can take stunning high-res photos of all those scenes that are just too contrasty to capture in a single picture.  Not only will seasoned photographers instantly fall in love with Pro HDR, one look at our example images should convince anyone that Pro HDR represents a new era in mobile photography.   Check out our gallery here: http://www.eyeapps.com/Gallery.html   Pro HDR Camera for Android comes with these incredibly useful features:   ?ÎÙ Automatic in-app HDR capture, where all you have to do is tap to capture   ?ÎÙ Manual in-app photo capture, where you get to choose the exposure of each image in your HDR   ?ÎÙ 3 Image Capture speeds to take pictures nearly instantly on phones that support it, while still compatible with older phones.  ?ÎÙ Proprietary image alignment algorithm that precisely aligns full-size images in seconds   ?ÎÙ Sophisticated image blending creates one beautiful output image nearly instantly   ?ÎÙ Live-updating image adjustment sliders to perfect your HDR:  Choose the perfect brightness, contrast, saturation, warmth, and tint, or let Pro HDR automatically maximize image quality.  ?ÎÙ Take pictures using hardware buttons (volume up/down or the shutter button if your phone has one)  ?ÎÙ Silent capture - mute your shutter sounds for quiet capture  * Camera ZOOM  * Front Camera!  ?ÎÙ Fullscreen image preview in portrait and landscape orientation   ?ÎÙ Save HDR images at the full resolution of your camera.  ?ÎÙ Efficient background processing that renders your HDRs while you keep on shooting  ?ÎÙ Built-in HDR gallery view to peruse, share, and re-edit your HDRs  ?ÎÙ Share your HDRs with the world with e-mail, and social networks.  ?ÎÙ Google+ Instant Upload. Save to DCIM folder to enable!  IMPORTANT: Pro HDR Camera requires Android 2.2 or later. Pro HDR Camera works on Motorola, HTC and Samsung devices.  The exposure functions on LG phones and the Nexus S seem to be broken, so HDR functionality will likely not work (though the rest of the features will). The Nexus S doesn't truly adjust the exposure, but seems to darken or brighten the image in software.

Elder Sign: Omens places you in control of up to four intrepid investigators, as they fight to keep all-powerful Ancient Ones from invading our world through a museum?Î∏s arcane exhibits!   *Build a team of unique investigators*  *Explore an ever-changing museum*  *Face challenging arcane tasks*  *Save the world from absolute destruction* *Expand the horror with two exciting in-app purchases*  Can you stand against the impending arrival of a malevolent Ancient One?    While Elder Sign: Omens brilliantly conveys the spirit of the Elder Sign dice game, a few noteworthy differences were adopted to optimize the mobile play experience:   -A limited number of available Ancient Ones streamlines the game play experience while offering adjustable levels of difficulty. Face Yig in normal mode, Azathoth or Tsathoggua in hard mode, or Cthulhu or Ithaqua in very hard mode (in-app purchases required to face Cthulhu and Ithaqua). -A number of subtle changes increase the peril of defending humanity. For example, the random negative effects drawn every midnight are more challenging, and the frequency of ?Î“no effect?Îú results has been decreased. Monsters have likewise been altered to make them more difficult.  -Finally, there are no Ally cards in Elder Sign: Omens, which further streamlines play while increasing the overall challenge.

USE_INTERNET;Turn your phone or tablet into an air traffic radar and see planes around the world move in real-time on a detailed map. Or point your Android device at a plane in the sky to find out where it?Î∏s going and more. Discover today why millions are already using Flightradar24. Features that have helped make Flightradar24 the #1 selling app in 25+ countries and the #1 Travel app in 140+ countries (United States, France, United Kingdom, Germany and more) include:  * Watch planes move in real-time on detailed map * Identify planes flying overhead by simply pointing your device at the sky * Experience what the pilot of a an aircraft sees in real-time and in 3D * Tap on a plane for comprehensive flight and aircraft information such as route, estimated time of arrival, actual time of departure, aircraft type, speed, altitude, and high-resolution picture * Easy to search for individual flights using flight number, airport, or airline * Easy to filter by airline, aircraft, altitude, speed, and more * Easy to set bookmarks to enable quick navigation to areas of interest * Turn the device into the arrivals and departures board of any major airport and get real-time status updates for flights plus current airport weather conditions (in-app purchase) * Realistic aircraft symbols (in-app purchase) * Set up custom alerts based on airline, aircraft type, flight number or registration (in-app purchase)   HOW IT WORKS Most aircraft are equipped with so called ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of several thousand ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions Flightradar24, with the help of multilateration, is able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don?Î∏t have ADS-B transponders.  Traditional radar data is also used in the app thanks to a direct feed from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This data provides near real-time coverage of all US and Canadian airspace.  http://www.flightradar24.com/how-it-works  ***IMPORTANT NOTICES*** Minimum required screen resolution is 320x480px.  If you are only interested in tracking air traffic in a specific region, we suggest that you check Flightradar24.com BEFORE purchasing the app. Flightradar24 provides unrivaled positional aircraft data coverage around the world but there are areas where we don?Î∏t have coverage.   Overview of coverage as of March 2014: * Europe: close to 100% * North America: 100% of US and Canada via slightly delayed radar data. Real-time coverage for most of US, Canada and Mexico for ADS-B equipped aircraft * South America: Substantial coverage in most countries including Brazil, Argentina and Chile * Asia: Substantial coverage in most major Asian countries including Japan, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, UAE, Malaysia, Taiwan and many other countries. Rapidly expanding coverage in China  * Oceania: Nearly complete coverage in Australia and New Zealand * Africa: Substantial coverage in South Africa. Limited but growing coverage in the rest of the region  Find out how you can help: http://www.flightradar24.com/increase-coverage  Coverage is subject to change at any time.

ANDROID_TOOL;(Please read the WARNING below BEFORE posting negative reviews, please contact us if you think Video Rotate did not rotate your video). Video Rotate solves the problem of the phone incorrectly detecting (or recording) orientation when shooting video and allows you to correctly rotate video. Video Rotate is compatible with most MPEG-4 (.MP4 & .3GP) format files.  Rotation is carried out by modifying the header (metadata) of the video file, there is no encoding / decoding of the video data hence processing is extremely fast and this lossless operation can be carried out as many times as you wish without degrading video quality. After video is rotated it is renamed with a rotation suffix (-r090, -r180 etc.)  * List all videos in media library * Force refresh of media library * Rotate video by 90, 180 or 270 degrees without re-encoding * Automatic updating of video library * Basic video player which honors rotation correctly (NEW) * Video deletion (NEW) * Video information detail including codecs and bitrate (NEW)  Compatible with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).  If you have any issues using this application please don't hesitate to contact us.  * WARNING *  Video Rotate works by modifying the rotation matrix in the video metadata (header). This is industry standard matrix is recognized by the built-in Android video player, the player built into Video Rotate itself, Quicktime (Mac & PC), Facebook, Youtube, Vimeo etc.  KNOWN ISSUE with HTC phones - it appears that HTC (in their infinite wisdom) have replaced the standard Android media player with their own which does not correctly support the rotation flag and instead stretches the appearance of the video. Note that the video is correctly rotated but will not play correctly on the phone.  ** Windows Media Player and DivX Player do NOT support rotation matrix and we therefore recommend you use Quicktime if you intend to transfer your videos back to your computer for playback **  Best for playback of rotated videos on Mac / PC:  http://www.apple.com/quicktime/

New alerts will appear on the status bar, and by selecting it, you can read the details.  You can also choose how urgent of a notification to get, based on the NWS Severity. An Extreme alert coming through? Then you'd probably like vibrate, lights AND bell for that! But a simple Wind Warning? Probably not as much. You can choose the level of response in the preferences.  Pro Weather Alert has all of the features of Simple Weather Alert, and more!  + No ads. + Monitor unlimited locations, each with an intuitive name you set. + See the details and instructions of all alerts for all areas. + See where around you the alerts are using the Alert Map. No more wondering if you're driving into or out of bad weather. + Choose how to be notified (lights, bell, vibrate), and decide which alerts will override your phone silence settings. + Sort and Filter the alerts in the list, by severity or location. + Two alert levels (?Î“emergency?Îú and ?Î“urgent?Îú) are customizable, in case you want lights, bell, and vibrate for extreme alerts, and just lights for severe alerts. All other weather alerts will give a simple notice on the action bar. + Individually select which NWS alerts you want to be considered  Emergency  or  Urgent  + Alerts keep updated automatically as long as you have connectivity + Find your alert location by GPS or network location, and have alerts follow your phone as you move. + An app widget added to your home screen allows for easy on/off toggling of lights, vibrate and sound settings. The alerts will still be checked and put on your status bar though, so you can keep an eye on it during class or church, without it causing distraction. You can also toggle the location following feature to save battery when not driving. + Key words and phrases list. Create a list of words or phrases, and when an alert is received that contains those words or phrases, it will be marked in the alerts list with an icon, and the phrases will be highlighted when you read the alert details. + Email an alert to friends or send via text message (**requires Contacts List permission**), so they can be warned as well. + Post your alert to our Facebook wall or Twitter feed! This is especially useful for non-weather alerts, such as Child Abduction Emergencies. + Change your alert polling times to maximize battery life. + Constant alerting annoying? You can now mute repeated alerts so those busy storm nights don't un-necessarily alert you.  NOTE: Do *NOT* use RAM or memory clearing apps. It will disable this app and you will not receive alerts. You can view the app manual here or in the app: http://android.globalcanofworms.com/guides/swa_pwa/Simple_Pro_Weather_Alert_Manual.html  An explanation of permissions: The SMS and Contacts List permission are required so you can send an alert to someone via text message. The contacts list permission allows for easier selecting of the number.  IMPORTANT: While we take all possible precautions to make sure this app will get you critical alerts on time, the unforseen can still occur, as well as simple cell/network outages.

GAME;"The #1 Storage Auction game on the AppStore has come to Android. Enter virtual storage unit auctions. Look inside when the door is raised and decide how high you will bid. Touch items and containers in your purchased rooms to empty them and hopefully find treasure instead of junk.  ?ÎÙ No in-app purchases! None!!!!!!! ?ÎÙ No ads! None !!!!!!!! ?ÎÙ Photo Realistic Graphics ?ÎÙ Random room generation ?ÎÙ 3 Difficulty Settings  When tenants of self-storage facilities have failed to pay their bill, the storage facility is allowed to have an auction of the contents of that locker. These auctions are open to the public and allow bidders an opportunity to attempt to profit by reselling the items within.  Before the door opens, you will see which bidders have shown up for that round. Some are nicer than others. So watch yourself when the aggressive ones are around, and buy more when they are not. Once the door opens, a timer will count down for 5 seconds. Then the bidding will begin. These auctions are part strategy and part luck.  ?ÎÙ Strategy Look at the contents of the room and consider the value of the large visible items. Does the bidding match your thoughts on the room?Î∏s value?  ?ÎÙ Luck How many boxes and storage tubs are there? Remember that each one is opened individually and the items within can add up fast, especially when you find some of the more valuable items that are possibly inside.  If you think the competition is bidding too high, let your fellow bidders have the room; and at the end of the round, ENJOY seeing how much they lost on it. If you think the room is being underbid, be sure to get it. This will be the best way to grow your money. Each round has 3 rooms for sale. Once all 3 rooms are sold, you are allowed to go through and empty each room you purchased.  Touch each item, box and storage tub individually to remove that item and see how the room adds up. The cost and the current value of each item removed is displayed as it is touched and a running tally is generated. Of course, you are hoping the value is greater then the cost.  Some rooms have a rare item inside. Sometimes they are in plain sight. Sometimes they are behind something or are inside a box or storage tub that looks like any other. You can view your rare item collection before starting each round and should consider them a source of pride in how you have played.  You start with $2,000 bidding money. When you get ahead, you put the bulk of your money in the bank. 10% of the value you have in the bank is added to your bidding money. If you play well, both these values will grow over time.  The contents of every room are randomly generated. This random selection includes not only which items are in a given room and where they are located in the room, but also which items are in the boxes & storage tubs. This means no matter how many times you play the game, no two rooms will be exactly the same.  Storage Auction has been a hit with users.  by Mkopppgfdcsgc - Aug 25, 2013 I love the show storage hunters and the game just makes me smile I love how u get to go through your locker and one time I think I got a collectible worth 150,000  by Seriously2 - Aug 13, 2013 This game is so fun and addicting.

As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and led directly to the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again.  Magic Age 1053?Î‡  Tragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun?Î‡the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back.  It starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire.  Petun?Î‡little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map.

GAME;This app is now optimized for both phones and tablets. Tip: Try our Kids ABC Phonics FREE first. If you like it (and you will love it), then get this paid version - it doesn't stop at the letter H and offers a child lock.   ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Preceded by: ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Kids ABC Letters and followed by Kids Learn to Read. Kids ABC Phonics is the second app in our Reading Curriculum Series.  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê A few housekeeping notes: ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê ?“Û Problems when attempting to download? This is a known issue of the Android Market. Scroll to the bottom of this description for some Google-recommended solutions that work. ?“Û Have Suggestions or Issues? Email questions@intellijoy.com and you'll get a prompt response.  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Intended for: ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Kids ages 2-7 (Yes, parents tell us even two-year-olds are using it!)   ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê  I couldn't get my phone back!  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê This delightful game invites preschool-aged children to listen and learn the ABCs in ways that enchant them.   ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê What will my children learn? ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê With Kids ABC Phonics, your kids will learn the alphabet letter sounds ?Î’ guaranteed!  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê What won't my children learn? ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Kids ABC Phonics teaches letter sounds and the basics of blending, but does not teach the next step, which is fluency in actual reading. Developing reading skills is a separate educational goal, which is covered in a separate game, called Kids Learn to Read, which was featured at the Google I/O on May 11th. Including in-depth reading skills in Kids ABC Phonics would detract from the focus of this game and make it too complex to invite and delight children.  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê What activities are included in this game? ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê The game has four wonderfully child-friendly sections.  ?__ Learn Letter Sounds. Kids hold and turn a picture-filled letter block and hear the ABC phonics being pronounced.  ?_ö Build Letter Blocks. Children have fun building phonics recognition skills by making their own ABC blocks.  ?_◊ Pop Letter Bubbles. Kids love to pop bubbles. But don't be fooled. By the time children are done with this game, they will know what letter goes with which sound by heart.  ?_õ Make words. While putting puzzles together, kids learn the basics of phonics blending. These skills will be further exercised and expanded in the upcoming Kids Reading game.  Every section is designed so children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable lady teacher. So they want to keep learning.  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Hey, how did you take the top spots in the Education section? ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê ?∏µ Our games are laser focused. For example, the letters game doesn't teach phonics, and the phonics game doesn't teach reading. We keep the games clean and focused but magically inviting and nourishing.  ?∏µ Our games don?Î∏t feature fun at the expense of education ?Î’ or education at the expense of fun. We also know games that are too complicated don?Î∏t involve and delight kids.  We love to hear from parents ?Î’ and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Download issues? ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Here are some Google-recommended solutions for this known Android Market issue:  ?“Û Make sure your phone is logged into Google Talk.

NONE;Now optimized for both phones and tablets, Kids Learn to Read (Preschool) is the long awaited sequel to our best-selling Kids ABC Phonics. This paid version has 15 extra words in the first and the third activities.  Featured at the Google I/O developer conference in San Francisco, Kids Learn to Read is the latest child-pleasing addition to Intellijoy's best-selling reading curriculum series, and is preceded by Kids ABC Letters and Kids ABC Phonics.  Kids Learn to Read is a delightful game that invites preschool-aged children to practice blending sounds together to read and spell simple words, such as  dog ,  sun , and  big .  In its three sections, children get to:  - learn to blend letter sounds into words by moving Tommy the Turtle across the letter bridge as each letter is sounded out and a word is formed and pronounced. Your kids can hand Tommy a skateboard to make him go faster as they become comfortable with blending the sounds.  - have fun practicing elementary reading as they are asked to fit Tommy's animal friends with skateboards and helmets  - make words in a way that's fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out  If your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our Kids ABC Phonics app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Kids ABC Letters app.  Every section is designed to let children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher, so they want to keep learning. Once your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time - and learning.

ANDROID_TOOL;Lag reduction for ROOT USERS ONLY!  Many Android tasks run slower than they should for one simple, yet not-so-obvious reason: they consume large amounts of random data from a limited source. Random data is used to generate session keys and unique identifiers, in SSL and wifi, while starting processes, and during inter-process communication.  This data (entropy) runs out frequently, and that causes processes reading from the blocking device (if any) to temporarily stop responding (lag). These processes cannot continue until the Linux kernel repopulates the entropy pool, which takes time. In addition, input events are pulled from the user interface (to refill the pool), which may also contribute to the problem.  Seeder is a service for root users. It assists the kernel in  topping off  the entropy pool by re-seeding it with data from the non-blocking (high performance) random device. Optionally, it can also help alleviate MMC I/O contention by extending the I/O queue, allowing the I/O scheduler to make better decisions, and combine more writes.  On some devices, applications load significantly faster (particularly large ones like Facebook, Chrome, and Youtube), and task switching becomes effortless. Fewer visual  hiccups  occur.  You MUST be running a rooted device to use this application! If you don't know what this means, Seeder will probably not work on your device!  ** Note **  This app does not increase raw performance, but rather eliminates some types of annoying lag (ie. applications briefly freezing, jerky scrolling, delays returning to the home screen, etc). The effect seems to be more noticeable the longer the device has been running prior to activating the RNG service.  Google's efforts to optimize newer builds of Android have been substantial, and Seeder has less effect on Android 4.0+ (though many users still report improvement).  Bug reports are greatly appreciated. If you have any trouble with the application, please send an email before leaving a review. If during testing you find that Seeder does not noticeably reduce lag on your device, please email me for a refund!

NONE;A Fast HDR camera experience with regular updates and new features added all the time. Now with optional Android 4.4 style user interface  Snap Camera lets you take pictures and record video with a single click, no cluttered preview screen, just the two buttons you really need.   Snap Camera's interface is based on the camera included in Android 4.4 (kitkat) on the Nexus 5 but with many extra features.  If you want to test this camera before buying, please install the trial version.. The trial version has all the features of the paid app but will only start immediately in Airplane mode.  Snap Camera has a simple, powerful user interface featuring:   * Touch to focus * Pinch to zoom * Swipe to review * Long press to adjust photo settings with the photo controller.   The photo controller includes settings for:  * Colour and Contrast (if supported by the hardware). * Silent Shutter * Burst Mode * Self Timer * Stable Shot * Panorama mode * Flash mode * Whitebalance * Exposure * Grid lines * Fast picture mode * HDR * Additional Settings  The additional settings menu gives you access to many extra settings.  * Picture and Video Size * Scene mode * Self Timer delay * Burst Mode settings * Time Lapse * Still and Video Focus Modes * JPEG Quality * Effects * ISO  * Anti-banding * Scene Detection * Video Bitrate, Format and Codec * Audio Settings  The photo editor lets you: * Add colour effects * Add a border * Crop, Rotate, Mirror * Straighten * Add image effects * Histogram Modification * Vignette  Additional Features   - You can see what effects will be applied and undo an effect at any time from the history menu - Share an image with any other app such as Facebook or Google+ by clicking on the share icon - Create panoramas by selecting the panorama icon (Android 4.0 and above) - Fast picture mode instantly captures photos at the preview resolution. - Capture still snapshots during video recording (if supported) - Use the volume buttons to focus and take a picture or zoom - Auto torch mode for low light video recording - Use the advanced video settings to record video in resolutions not allowed by other cameras. For example, this gives you 720p video recording on the Nexus 7 - Stable shot mode only takes a photo when the camera is completely still  High Dynamic Range (HDR)  HDR is a feature that lets you take pictures of scenes with very dark and very light areas. The app takes two photos at different exposures and combines them to make one HDR photo. By default the app will save the original exposures and open an HDR editor but this behaviour can be changed from the settings menu.  See here for details of HDR:  http://marginz.co.nz/index.html#HDR  Refunds: Please contact us if you have any issues with Snap Camera, we will give you a refund and later notify you once we've fixed the problem.  Some features are only available on newer devices.   Camera apps are notoriously difficult to make compatible with all hardware. Please install and test the trial version first before you buy the paid app.  Please visit our website for tips and more details about the settings and features.  There is a discussion forum here:  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2055140  Please use this to report bugs, ask questions and suggest new features. Remember to say which device you have and which Android version it is running.  This app will install 2 icons in your launcher, one for the Gallery and one for the Camera. Some launchers also put the Gallery icon on your home screen.

When you installed Poweramp 2.0, it just got filled with the files scanned from your sd card/other flash memory, as specified in Music Folders.   Q. Volume too low. Volume changes weirdly.

ANDROID_TOOL;"SetCPU is a tool for changing the CPU settings on a rooted Android phone or tablet. SetCPU works with a great variety of Android devices and ROMs, including the HTC One series, Samsung Galaxy series, and Nexus devices. You're under control: SetCPU can improve your performance, save battery, or both! Automate SetCPU with profiles! SetCPU allows you to set up powerful profiles to change your settings under certain conditions, such as what app is running, when the phone is asleep or charging, when the battery level drops below a certain point, when the phone's temperature is too high, or during certain times of day. See the screenshots for examples of how you might set up profiles.  SetCPU's wide feature set make it useful to Android beginners and enthusiasts alike. Accelerate your processor to unleash your phone's true multitasking potential, or dial your CPU's speed down to save battery.  SetCPU also includes a  voltage control  menu, available to certain devices with custom kernels that support it, to control undervolting to save even more battery. Undervolting is only available for certain kernels.  3.1.0 Hey guys! It's good to be back ;) I have been very busy with school for the past year. 3.1.0 is mostly a bug fix release for some standing issues, but expect much more frequent updates from now on.  - Added SUPERUSER permission. - Fixed a bug where action bar menu items would sometimes not appear for the profiles menu. - Fixed a bug where voltage items would appear in reverse with some custom kernels. - Added an open source licenses menu item in About.  Mike  coolbho3k  Huang  Permissions: Root: SetCPU needs root permissions to modify the CPU speed and other settings.  Read logs: is used for efficient app condition checking. That is currently all it's used for.  Start at boot: SetCPU will start a profiles service at boot, if enabled. It also sets default boot settings, if enabled. SetCPU does not run in the background if profiles are not enabled, and becomes inactive after settings, if any, are applied.  Wake lock: This prevents the phone from sleeping while stress testing and benchmarking.  Write external storage: SetCPU needs to read from and write to the SD card or internal storage to back up profiles.  Read phone state: The  in call  condition needs this to determine if the user is making a phone call or not, and trigger the profile if the user wants to.  "

NONE;"Spirit1 is a real, tuned,  over the air  FM radio app. It is NOT a streaming app which requires expensive data plans and drains your battery. NOTE April 8: Spirit2 is now in general release: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.a2d.s2 . But don't despair; Spirit1 is alive and well and continues to be updated...  Spirit2 supports only the most popular, recent, higher end devices that have digital audio support in Spirit1 Unlocked. The Spirit2 UI and underlying architecture are much improved. But Spirit1 Unlocked is still more mature, bug-free and has more features.  NOTE March 2014: Samsung and HTC are now actively preventing 3rd party FM apps from working on stock, un-rooted phones, using Knox, system permissions and other means. Reverse engineering undocumented APIs was hard enough, but this signals the death of access to stock, unrooted OEM proprietary FM APIs by  non-blessed  3rd party FM apps (IE, Spirit, pretty much).  The existing Spirit support for stock, unrooted devices will remain, but due to these developments, it is now unfeasible to continue updating this support as I did just recently for the new Broadcom API.  The focus of Spirit will now, more than ever, be on AOSP ROMs. If you don't know what AOSP ROMs are, Spirit is likely not the app for you, and you should stick with the stock FM app. Further details: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=50954346&postcount=7641  Satisfaction guaranteed or full refund. Cancel any time on request, within 30 days. To cancel, email mikereidis@gmail.com with at least your name, email of purchase, and/or order ID or email receipt.  If you're an average phone user, & don't know what Android  rooting  is, Spirit will likely not offer you much more than your stock FM app. If your phone does not have a stock FM app, it is unlikely that Spirit will work on it.  Spirit is mostly for Android enthusiasts who  root  &  ROM  their phones. But it also works on many stock,  store bought  phones.  Spirit Unlocked includes:  - Digital audio features supported ONLY on: ROOTED Non-stock AOSP International Galaxy S/S2/S3/Note/Note2/Player, HTC One/OneXL/OneS/Evo 4G LTE/Xperia T and most Sony 2012+ devices.  - RDS data display in App, Lock-screen & Notification window. RT, PS, PTY, PI & AF RadioText RT, Program Service PS, Program Type PTY, Program ID PI & Alternate Frequency AF.  - Lock-screen & Wired Headset Media Button support for mute, preset, seek, volume & record.  - Many settings: Audio, UI, AF, Digital & Debug categories.  - Unlimited Presets & Preset Lists.  FAQ / Frequently Asked Questions: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=31983089  I understand the price may seem high, but this is a niche app with 10,000 hours of work required over 3+ years. How many other  Real FM Radio  apps are on Google Play ? Almost none.  Why ? Because Android FM is extremely difficult. Google doesn't support FM radio and carriers suppress it. Intensive reverse engineering is required. In the over 3 years since Spirit was first created, nobody else has been  crazy  enough to attempt to compete in this niche (OTA radio) within a niche (AOSP ROMs) or without (all phones with usable FM).  Spirit is not a throwaway game app you play for a few days. How many hours will you spend listening to FM radio in the next several years ?  How much can you save on data plans by listening to free, over the air radio versus streaming ?  If you care about app quality, note CNet article  We're not paying enough for apps : http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=23568502&postcount=2523  I'm one developer and Spirit is my only app and income. I'm trying to do a job Google said they couldn't for lack of developer resources. :)  Your support for Spirit is appreciated.  For tons of further info, and links to free test versions, please see my XDA thread: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=13385163  Thanks ! Mike.  "

That's why I created Gentle Alarm which tries to wake you up during light sleep using an optional pre-alarm.   Alarm clocks can't know if you are in light sleep or deep sleep (those movement based alarm clock don't work) but they can play a very quiet pre-alarm which you will only hear if you are in light sleep. If you are in deep sleep, you will simply sleep through the pre-alarm.  The pre-alarm plays 30min before you really want to get up (you can change that). If the pre-alarm wakes you up, you will be more refreshed than if you had slept until the main alarm because at that time you would have fallen back into deep sleep. Give it a try and I am sure you won't want to miss it anymore.  Of course, the app has all the usual features of a great alarm clock: It can switch to a night display automatically when docking the phone. It can automatically shorten the snooze time with each time you press snooze. It can automatically create playlists of your favorite artist or genre. And it allows you to change colors, fonts, and backgrounds.  PERMISSIONS:  * RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: So it can activate an alarm after you reboot the phone. After reboot, all alarms of all apps are cancelled by default.  * WAKE_LOCK: So the phone can stay on while playing an alarm or while displaying the night display.  * DISABLE_KEYGUARD: When the alarm rings, you don't have to unlock the phone to be able to turn the alarm off.  * VIBRATE: obvious  * WRITE_SETTINGS: It adjusts some system settings such as airplane mode, silent mode, etc.  * WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: It logs some data on your SD card.  * READ_PHONE_STATE: So it can turn off the alarm when the phone rings and prevent an alarm from ringing while you are talking on the phone.  * READ_LOGS: So you can send me debug data (if you choose to)  * INTERNET: So that I can display ads (trial version only). Also, if the app crashes, it offers to send me a debug report directly to my servers. The app will politely ask you if you want to send that data or not. If you do, it needs an internet connection. If not, it doesn't but I still need the permission in the app because you may want to send the debug data.  
ANDROID_TOOL;free TRIAL version avail The perfect nap/sleep app. The little brother of Gentle Alarm...  ** Buyers within the European Union: 19% VAT will be add to the sales price **  PLEASE NOTE: due to a bug in Android 4.0, the sounds provided with the app may skip when looping.

Each program has up to three phases, relaxing, sleeping, and waking up. For each phase you can set your own music or use the built-in sounds, set fade-in/fade-out, duration, etc.  The app can detect when you start sleeping through motion detection so you can nap for exactly 10 min even though you don't know how long it will take you to fall asleep.  Use the relax phase to listen to an audio book. The app will continue the time it runs where it left off.  Explanation of PERMISSIONS:  PERMISSIONS: Gentle Alarm uses the following permissions...  * WAKE_LOCK: So the phone can stay on while playing music.  * DISABLE_KEYGUARD: When the alarm rings, you don't have to unlock the phone to be able to turn the alarm off.  * VIBRATE: obvious  * WRITE_SETTINGS: It adjusts some system settings such as airplane mode, silent mode, etc.  * WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: It logs some data on your SD card.  * READ_PHONE_STATE: So it can turn off the music when the phone rings and prevent an alarm from ringing while you are talking on the phone.  * READ_LOGS: So you can send me debug data (if you choose to)  * INTERNET: So that I can display ads (trial version only). Also, if the app crashes, it can send a crash if you allow it. Even if you don't use this feature, the app still needs to ask for the permission.

USE_INTERNET;Calibre Companion (CC), recommended by calibre developers, is three applications in one:  - a superb device-based calibre library organizer  - a high-performance WiFi-based calibre device emulator  - a calibre content server (web access) client 1) CC is a device-based calibre library organizer. Once you put books on your device using one of the connection methods described below you can: - view a book's metadata (author, tags, series, rating, dates, etc.). - sort and group books by their metadata. - see book lists by cover or by list. - mark books read and sync this information with calibre. - launch your book reader application to read a book (works with most reader applications except for Amazon Kindle).  2) CC can connect to calibre over WiFi and be detected by calibre as a device. Once connected, you use calibre to move books to and from your device. Calibre automatically updates all the book metadata stored by CC to match the latest in your library. No other app, reader or browser, offers this level of integration with calibre.  3) CC can connect to calibre?Î∏s content server over WiFi to browse your library and download books to your device.  For more information see our FAQ (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=188899)  Notes:  1) CC is not a reader app. You must install and use one of the many excellent reader apps available.  2) CC requires that you use calibre calibre 0.9.02 or later, available at http://calibre-ebook.com/. Some CC features such as syncing book read information require newer versions of calibre.  Seeing the benefits of Calibre Companion?Î∏s features can take some time. Do not worry about the 15-minute refund window. If after exploring both kinds of connections you are not satisfied with CC, contact us and we will refund your purchase.  **** Permissions explanation: - Allow Wi-Fi multicast reception: multicast is required to be able to find calibre without requiring you to enter an IP address. - Users with Jellybean (Android 4.1): You will also see a permission about ?Î“Test access to protected storage?Îú. This is caused by a change Android is making regarding SD card access, and simply means our app can save books on your external storage.

The only way for an app to be placed in /system/app is via a rooting process (which usually installs Superuser), or by remounting the system partition as read/write and manually putting it there.

NONE;This is just a donation package which activates some experimental features (require ROOT) in the Greenify (free) app. Enable features from the main menu of Greenify. === 3 Days Refund Guarantee ===  Don't worry about the 15 minutes window, just relax and explore all the features. Refund requested in Google Wallet within 3 days is guaranteed. (may take days to manually process). REQ BY EMAIL WILL BE IGNORED  === Disclaimer ===  Some of these experimental features are still in early stage. They may not work on all devices & ROMs. They are included only for advanced users with sufficient knowledge about what they really mean and how to correctly use them. These features may crash your apps, or even brick your phone in the extreme cases. I will try my best to avoid those situations, but I don't take responsibility about the possible consequences. For your safety, please do a NANDroid backup before activating these features.  It is safe to purchase and install, since nothing is affected before any of the experimental features is enabled explicitly.  === Installation ===  1. Install this donation package 2. Download and install Xposed installer: http://goo.gl/CKTWXZ 3. Install the ?Î“Framework  in the  Xposed Installer  and activate  Greenify  in  Modules . 4. Reboot 5. Select  Experimental features  from main menu of Greenify, enable whatever features you want.  === Experimental Features ===  ?„ˇ Boost mode  Android framework is patched to allow Greenify to perform hibernation and other operations without the root routine, which is usually buggy (for some root tools) and slow.  ?„ˇ Allow (most) system apps to be greenified in Greenify  Android framework is patched to deprive system apps of immunity to hibernation.  Beware, most system apps are critical to the basic functionality of your device, once greenified, you may lose some part of usability. If something bad happens, degreenify the system apps you recently greenified and reboot, or deactivate this experimental features of Greenify and reboot.  ?„ˇ Allow GCM push message to wake hibernated apps  Google service framework is patched to allow the GCM (Google Cloud Message, a.k.a. C2DM) broadcast to wake the hibernated apps, thus you can greenify some apps without losing the ability to receive push message.  Attention: Not all apps use GCM as push mechanism, some apps create their own connection for push in background service, thus can't benefit from this patch and their push messages can never survive hibernation. Please DO NOT ask for that, it's just a  mission impossible  in practice. Instead, ask their developer to adopt the more RAM-and-battery-friendly GCM push.  ?„ˇ Keep Notifications after Hibernation  Android framework is patched to keep notifications from being removed when application hibernates.  ?„ˇ Wake-up Tracker  Android framework is patched to track which app implicitly woke your hibernated apps. You can decide whether to cut-off the wake-up path to avoid further wake-ups.  ?„ˇ Block App State Abuse.  Block the the abuse (via a vulnerability of Android up to 4.2) used by some apps to keep themselves from being killed by Android. This abuse leads to undesired apps  Not Hibernating  due to false  Perceptible  state in Greenify.  PS: For Android 4.3+, this can also remove the annoying permanent notification from some apps, which was hidden in pre-4.3 system.  === Why do I need to install another framework for all these to work? ===  Since these experimental features all need OS level patches, traditionally they can only be applied with ROM modding, which is highly device-specific and ROM-exclusive. Xposed framework is a new hope to do finer grained tiny patches in a ROM-independent way. Thanks to Xposed framework, you can enjoy these experimental features of Greenify without replacing your ROM.  === Feedback and further discussion ===  Visit the community: http://goo.gl/MoszF or XDA forum: http://goo.gl/urHEa

What more can you ask for? (Review by Brantusk) - Amazing. I find nothing wrong with it. Just perfect game. (Review by ReidWassmer) - One of the best games on the iPhone! (Review by Frankie Cordova)  Synopsis&gt; In a far future, the mother earth has lost vitality due to overwhelming greed and selfishness of human. Not so long after, the gods eventually decide to annihilate the entire human race. Instead, critters have given intelligence to have a chance to establish their own civilization. They worshipped their creators and spent a millennium in peace. Different from human race, the critters were innocent, pure and peace loving creatures. Meanwhile the devils were struggling to find evil minds which once were full of and around when the earth was full of human. The devils, after all, decide to declare war on the critterland. Critters have long accustomed to peace. They seemed incapable to battle against the human undeads summoned from the hell by the devils and the fate of the nation seemed grim. At the very moment everyone was about to give up hope, one paladin arose from the dark to fight back for the peace of the critterland?Î_.  His name?Î_. was?Î_ Paladog.

Lighter Free displays a realistic-looking metal cigarette lighter on your device's screen. Use your finger to flip the lighter open, then touch the flint wheel to create a flame. When you tilt your phone, the flame follows your movements. To put out the flame, blow on your phone's microphone.  Personalize your lighter by changing the color of its components, the flame, and the background. You can even add a customized engraving that will appear on the lighter's side (we recommend something like  Pink Floyd Rules ).  Read phone state and identity permission: Just used for ads.

GAME;"With MILLIONS of users, Drift Mania is a MUST-HAVE for any car enthusiasts! Join the revolution and start Drifting TODAY! -TOUCH ARCADE:  Drift Mania Championship combines so many great things in to one racing game.   -CNET:  Drift Mania Championship is a drift racing game that offers excellent controls, smooth graphics, and challenging gameplay.   ____________________________________   If you like Drift Mania, please rate it 5 stars when an update comes out! As always, your 5-star rating and reviews keep the updates coming! Thanks for playing Drift Mania! ____________________________________   Drifting is the act of maneuvering a vehicle through corners at speeds and angles that exceed the vehicle?Î∏s grip. A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.   It?Î∏s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It?Î∏s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control.  Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can?Î∏t get any better!  ____________________________________   HOW TO PLAY  Drifting is a very unique Motorsport where points are allocated on 4 main criteria: Speed, Line, Angle and Impact.   LINE: Drift within pre-designated zones to get extra points. The line is marked by several clipping zones where the driver must get as close as possible while sideways to increase score.   ANGLE: The more the better. Drift with style and try to get your car as sideways as possible without wiping out to gain more points.   SPEED: Always try to drift as fast as possible while staying in control. If you hit a wall or get off-track, you will lose your current combo score. If you complete the race quickly, you will gain additional points.   IMPACT: This is the show factor! It?Î∏s about entertaining the crowd and delivering an exciting performance. Make them cheer; everyone enjoys the smell of burning rubber.  ____________________________________   NEXT GENERATION GAMEPLAY  Stunning 3D graphics using the multi-touch capabilities of your device to simulate an authentic drifting experience.

WIDGET;"Advanced Task Killer is also known as ATK which is #1 task manager app. It is a tool to kill applications and boost memory. It has all features which task manger has.  -Ignore List  -One tap widget  -Auto kill  -Customize item height ATK is often used to kill app and clean memory. We do suggest people use ATK manually kill apps instead of auto killing app.  1. How to use it (for new users to quick start)?  ATK is pretty simple. Open this tool and take a look at the running applications list? Uncheck some apps you don't want to kill (such as Advanced Task Killer and some system apps) Tap the button 'Kill selected apps', it will kill all applications checked.    2. How to use it (for new users to do more)?  If you don't want to kill any app, you can tap it on the running applications list. Then it's checking box will turn to gray.    3. Why there are app running that I haven't used or even opened?  Some app will start up once you turn on your phone or be invoked by some events.    4. What is ignore list/ignore?  Ignore list is for you to ignore some app you don't want to kill. If you long press on the app listed on the main screen of ATK, the menu will pop up, then you can select 'Ignore', the application would be moved to ignore list. When you tap 'Kill selected apps', it won't be killed any more.    5. What is default action for long press?  You can set your default action for long press and click on the settings. The system default action for long press is pop-menu. That means you when you long press on the application (displays on the running applications list), a pop-menu would shows up. For example, if you want to switch to the application after you long press on it, you can set the default action of long press to 'Switch to'.    6. Why I lost my network connection after I tap 'kill selected apps'?  This is because some apps related with network connection are killed, such as 'voicemail'. You can ignore it instead of killing it.    7. Why my Home reloaded?  This is because some apps related with Home are killed. Such as 'HTC Sense', 'Mail'(if it is integrated with Home). You can ignore it instead of killing it.    8. Why I cannot receive notification of Email?  This is because you killed 'Email'. Instead of killing it, you need to ignore it.    9. What is Auto Kill?  If you want to kill apps automatically you need to choose one of auto-kill level  - Safe: Only kill the apps aren't running but still consume memory.  - Aggressive: Kill the apps running background and apps aren't running.  - Crazy: All apps except for apps you are using with.  You should be able to see Auto Kill information shows on the title, like 'Auto-Kill: 12:20'. That means auto kill will start at 12:20, you can also change the frequency to impact the auto kill start time.   App killer is only a tool to kill apps and task. It won't help your battery directly. But if you kill any app which consumes battery a lot, you might think app killer is helping your battery. Advanced Task Killer Pro is paid version which doesn't contain ads. Note: For android 2.2 and later version, task manager cannot kill services and front apps, you have to force stop them. If you use task manager to kill them, services might restart; also notification won't be erased from the top bar. So we don't suggest people use task manager kill them.

USE_CONTACTS;"The original open-source ringtone editor for Android, first published in 2008 and downloaded by millions of users worldwide. Ringdroid lets you create personal ringtones, alarms, and notification sounds from existing music/audio files and record new ones using your Android device.  This app is the only 'official' distribution of the Ringdroid open-source project; it does not, and never will, contain ads.  Ringdroid requests permission to access your contacts solely for the purpose of setting contact-specific ringtones. It requests full network communication solely for the purpose of sending anonymous usage statistics as described in the app's 'Privacy' menu. Source code is available at ringdroid.com.  "
BACKUP;A simple App to Backup and Restore SMS Messages. This is a Paid No-Ads version of the Ad-Supported Free App. NOTE:  The backup is created only on the SD Card by default unless you configure it to upload to Email, Google Drive or Dropbox. You are responsible for backup files and the files are not sent to the developer in any case.  On Android 4.4+ devices, if you have performed the Restore and the messages don't appear in Hangouts then: - Open Hangouts and Disable SMS from Settings. - Exit the Hangouts app - Open Hangouts and Enable SMS from Settings.  APP FEATURES: - Backup SMS Messages in XML format. - Backup created locally on the device with options to automatically upload to Email, Google Drive or Dropbox using the Add-On app. - Choose a scheduled time to automatically backup. - Backup format is independent of the Android version so the messages can be easily moved from one phone to another, irrespective of the Android version. - Option to select which conversations to backup. - View/Restore all Messages or only selected conversations. - Delete all SMS Messages on the Phone. - Email a backup file.  - The XML can then be converted to other formats, and can also be viewed on a computer.  - Tested on Android v1.5 to v4.4.2  Please note that MMS (Picture/Audio/Video messages) support is currently in BETA.  On newer phones with inbuilt storage the default backup location will probably be the internal storage card and not the external.  This is because the phone reports the storage that way.  If you intend to do a factory reset on the phone, please make sure you save/email a copy of the backup outside the phone before doing it.   Lots more info at http://android.riteshsahu.com/apps/sms-backup-restore FAQs can be found at http://bit.ly/d9t7Jk  Please start the app at least once after updates so that the scheduled backups start working.  This App needs access to the following: * Your messages: Backup and Restore messages. Receive SMS permission needed to properly handle messages received while the app is the default messaging app on Android 4.4+ devices. * Storage: To create the Backup file on the SD card. * Phone calls - Without this the Restore fails on some phones. * Your social information: To display and store the contact names in the Backup file. * Run at start-up: Start scheduled Backups.  * Control Vibration: To vibrate the phone when an operation is completed. * Prevent Phone from Sleeping: To prevent the phone from going to sleep/suspended state while a Backup or Restore operation is in progress. * Test access to Protected Storage: To create the Backup file on the SD card.

It is a 1 second silent MP3.

Responses to reviews:  - To people saying it won't cast more than 8 feet, this has been fixed so 20 ft is the minimum distance. The tilt of the phone when you release the line determines the cast distance. Let go of the line a little while after you make a cast motion. You can actually hold it as long as you want and then let go.  If the rod doesn't move then your accelerometer isn't working on your phone and you should get that checked out.  If you have trouble running it on your phone, please contact me at support@rockingpocketgames.com and tell me what phone/model you have! I will buy the phone and make it work!

GAME;Cat Playground is a game for cats, not humans. Let your furry friend chase a mouse, fish, or a laser pointer, and earn points for everytime he catches it. Be warned tough, it may cause cat addiction. This cat toy will work on pretty much any Android phone with a touchscreen, tough it will work best with tablets and phones with a large display since it will make it easier for your cat.   FAQ:  Q - What the hell is a game for cats, this is a joke app right ? A - Absolutely not! Cats are natural hunters, and they will chase pretty much anything that moves. Just wave a string in front of them and they will chase it. The  problem  with normal toys is that it requires human intervention or the cat will soon be bored of something that doesn't move. With Cat Playground you can keep your feline friend entertained for much longer, even when you don't have time to play with him. Human supervision is still advised during play.  Q - My cat doesn't seem interested or just plainly ignores the app.  A - Just like people every cat has it's own personality. Some like to play more than others, or maybe your cat is simply not in the mood right now. Try showing them the app later, preferably when they are in a playful mood.  Q - Can my cat claws scratch my phone/tablet ? A - In theory yes, tough it's extremely unlikely. Phone screens are made to endure harsh punishment, and most of the screens found on phones are made from glass wich is several times harder than a cat's claws. We've had a kitten playing on a Samsung Galaxy Mini phone wich has a screen made from plastic, and the screen doesn't have a single scratch on it.  Q - Is there anything i should keep in mind while my cat is using the app ? A - Yes, human supervision is highly advised. Some cats can get pretty excited while playing Cat Playground and may try to bite or flip the phone. It's preferable to put the phone on the ground instead of a couch or table to prevent fall damage.

USE_INTERNET;Experience a totally new way to share today. Snap a photo or a video, add a caption, and send it to a friend (or maybe a few). They'll view it, laugh, and then the snap disappears from the screen - unless they take a screenshot! If you want to share a Snap with all of your friends, add it to your Snapchat Story, a living narrative where each Snap lives for 24 hours until it disappears, making room for the new. The images might be a little grainy, and you may not look your best, but that's the point. It's about the moment, a connection between friends in the present, and not just a pretty picture.   The allure of fleeting messages reminds us about the beauty of friendship - we don't need a reason to stay in touch.  ***  Please note: even though snaps are deleted from our servers after they are viewed, we cannot prevent the recipient(s) from capturing and saving the message by taking a screenshot or using an image capture device.

USE_INTERNET;The Best Catholic iPhone and iPad App is finally available for your Android Phone! [About.com Reader's Choice Awards 2011/2012/2013 winner]. This app is an opportunity for you to participate in the recitation of the Liturgy of the Hours: the public prayer of the Christian community. Hours included for each day are: * Invitatory * Office of Readings * Morning Prayer * Daytime Prayer - text only, no audio * Evening Prayer * Night Prayer  This app will automatically update its content while you are running it with an Internet connection.  This App is an audio and text version of the official set of daily prayers from the Liturgy of the Hours of the Roman Catholic Church (Breviary). It wirelessly downloads several days of prayers at a time, without the need for synchronization or access to a computer.  For clergy required to pray the Liturgy of the Hours daily, or laity who recite the daily prayers to maintain their intimate connection with God, The Divine Office App is designed to make praying more convenient, enjoyable, and simple enough for anyone to use. It automatically downloads the appropriate prayers for each office, every day of the year, including Solemnities, Feasts, and Memorials.   The Divine Office App uses the current four-volume Liturgy of the Hours with a bias towards the USA calendar. This version is the official prayer book of the Catholic Church, however, it is suitable for those following Eastern Orthodox and Anglican traditions.   When St. Paul advises us in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 to ?Î“pray without ceasing,?Îú he intends more than simply bowing our heads and speaking to God on a regular basis. He means for us to adopt an ongoing attitude of prayer that is a way of life and a constant intercession for the salvation of all mankind.  As the mystical body of Christ prays in unison, it fulfills what Paul advises as Christian conduct, that believers at once pray for the good of themselves, their neighbors, and the world. In this way, prayers become liturgy, a way to fulfill our divine calling and a practical approach for addressing the suffering of the world.

ANDROID_TOOL;"JELLY BEAN (ANDROID 4.1) USERS PLEASE READ  I've been waiting until I could get my hands on a SGS4 to update the description.  This application has always worked via exploiting a bug in Android's MediaServer, which is why there has never been any other applications like it (that can boost the volume of system sounds) on the Play Store. Google seem to have completely patched this exploit as of Android 4.1+. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about this; Volume+ will no longer work on newer devices.  Some devices running 4.1 CAN make use of this application (Samsung Galaxy S 3 international, HTC One X, etc.) but the majority will not. Most phones running pre-JB firmware will still be able to use this application as normal. Sorry about this everyone but there's nothing I can do anymore, NO AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT WILL EVER GET THIS WORKING AGAIN. Google broke it!  Please note; Incompatible devices running certain custom firmwares may still be able to make use of this application.  This application can be downloaded for FREE on my website along with beta builds that have not yet been released.  ** PowerAmp Fix - http://androidaudiohacks.com/?page_id=571 **  Thanks.  Tested and Fully working on the Samsung Galaxy S III!! (Doesn't currently work on the Sprint Version. No idea why.)  This application was designed primarily to boost the volume of a wired headset. Whilst it will boost the main loudspeaker volume, it may not be as prominant. Please bare this in mind.  Millions of people blame bad headphones for low-quality music, well put the blame where it belongs; your phone and the audio software. Volume+ can fix the issue system wide. Using Volume+ your phone will get a boost in bass, treble, and if you're using our presets, you can finally experience the quality of music that you truly deserve. Being system wide, Volume+ works with Google Music, Pandora, Slacker, and every other music software on your device (that doesn't have a built in EQ). Volume+ might not get you the same experience that you get with those over priced headphones, but what we can promise you is that for $2, you will get music that is finally worth listening to.   There may be issues on certain custom ROMs.  This software does not function the same on every ROM out there, we personally recommend using a Cyanogen Mod 7 or MIUI ROMs, but we do try our best to optimize our software for all software versions. Stock users message us if you're not getting an improved experience.   We highly recommend you use this with caution because while we do allow you to literally go crazy with the way you hear your music, you can seriously damage your hearing and possibly lose it. So please don't go crazy with our application, we want you to enjoy yourself not hurt yourself (please see disclaimer below).  DISCLAIMER: By downloading this application you agree to the fact that, as this app exploits the EQ API included in Gingerbread and it is not meant to be achieved under normal circumstances, I am NOT to be held responsible for anything negative that may occur, such as breakage to your phone or phone's speaker. I will also take no responsibility for any damage that may occur to your hearing. This app will allow you to boost the volume of the headset, bluetooth headset and modify the inbuilt EQ settings. As a result, you can now increase the volume of the headset/bluetooth headset way above the recommended maximum and so, may cause permanent damage to your speaker and/or hearing.  ********* This app is available for FREE on my website - www.androidaudiohacks.com *********  Download and use at your own risk.

In order to toggle which output you'd like to move, you tap the prism. The selected output laser will appear brighter and slightly larger than the non-selected laser. You can switch this behavior in the settings menu to allow you to move the laser of your choice by pressing on or near it and dragging.  Laser Colors We decided to use pigment colors by default for Refraction, but there is a settings option that will allow you switch between pigment and light based colors.  Permissions We use the external storage permission to save screenshots to. The internet permission is for analytics tracking by Localytics. It ends up mainly showing us how many people have pirated our game unfortunately :(.  Feedback We love love love feedback.

Root support (busybox with installed applets  tar ,  gzip  and  ls  required) - 1-Click batch restore - 1-Click batch uninstall - Backup paid & protected apps - Backup & restore app-data (f.e. settings)  Backup apps: - Automatic backup on new app installations - you have nothing to worry about - Multiple version backup, you can always downgrade any app - Backup apps to SD card - Restore apps from SD card - Backup/restore install-files (.apk) or Market-Links - Batch restore from SD card or from Market - Batch delete backups  Manage apps: - Quick uninstalling  - Search in apps and backups - Sort your apps by install-date, name, size etc. - Display apps with Ads (AdMob)  - Display apps can be moved to SD card  and more: - Access to extended options like APP2SD, cache, permissions - Scan SD card for install-files (.apk-files) - Share app-links via Facebook, Twitter, mail - Share install files directly - Send backed up apps (.apk-files) by mail, Dropbox or what ever   Since Android 4.4 KitKat on dual-storage devices (internal / external) apps can no longer write files to external SD card. Some apps can, but only files, f.e. pics, but no folders. AppMonster must write folders in order to work. As long Google does not make SD card useful again, the only workaround is to use internal storage to store your backups.   So if you on KitKat & dual-storage device change AppMonster's setting to use internal storage (see  Backup folder ).  I'm working on a solution.

GAME;Is there anything kids like more than animals? Well, here is a portable zoo for their learning and entertainment. It has more than 60 images with animal sounds and voiceovers. Toddler Tapping Zoo was specifically designed with toddlers and young children in mind. It will expand the horizons of infants and toddlers through beautiful eye-catching images and amusing sounds of animals.   Since experts have shown that toddlers are more enthusiastic and learn more from realistic photographs than from illustrations, we have designed this app around gorgeous photographs in landscape mode to make images larger.   Toddlers learn to distinguish sounds, associate sounds with images and fine-tune their motor skills. But most of all, they have a great time.   Read together while spending quality time or use them in an  emergency  to keep them entertained at a restaurant or check-out line.   Our tapping zoo consists carefully selected list of animals. It allows for simple sequential navigation. You don?Î∏t have to go back to the menu again and again.   Tap on an image and you get the sound of the animal. Tap on the text of the label and you get a professionally recorded voiceover in ENGLISH of the name of the animal.  Toddlers love repetition too. Seeing the same animals over and over helps them learn and allows they to reencounter them often, which for them is hilarious. (We know it can be frustrating as a parent, but they love it).    Toddler Tapping Zoo  contains images and sounds of over 60 animals including:   Dog, cat, cow, horse, pig, sheep, rooster, parrot, owl, duck, lion, elephant, monkey, bear, orca, dolphin, mouse, snake, frog, camel, hippo, squirrel, koala, eagle, bee, seal, penguin and more.

LOCATE_POSITION;Judge Robert Restaino jailed 46 people when a mobile phone rang in his courtroom and no one admitted responsibility. So we invented Localeí˘! Locale's advanced artificial intelligence manages settings automatically. For example: arrive at work and instantly your ringer silences, your wallpaper snaps to that scenic Caribbean photo, and Wi-Fi switches on. With Locale, never worry about your ringer going off accidentally again. Once you experience Locale's power and convenience, you'll never want to be without it. Set it and forget it!   LOCATION Locale leverages patent pending artificial intelligence geofencing algorithms for instant location detection.  Configuring is simple?Î‡it just works! To create a geofence location, drag and drop the pin on the map, resize the radius using your finger, and Locale does the rest.   The best part? No battery drain. Locale's sophisticated sensor fusion technology combines accelerometer, cell, Wi-Fi, GPS, and other signals for optimal accuracy, performance, and battery life. During our extensive testing across dozens of popular Android devices, we found Locale's typical battery impact too small to even measure.   PLUG-INS Locale manages more than your ringer. Along with built-in conditions (Battery, Calendar (Android 4.0+), Caller, Location, Orientation, Time) and built-in settings (Bluetooth, Display Brightness, Display Timeout, Ringtone, Volume, Media Volume, Shortcut, Wallpaper, Wi-Fi), Locale expands with an advanced plug-in architecture.

BUZZ Locale won the grand prize of Google's Android Developer Challenge, because it is one of the coolest apps for Android and showcases what the Android platform can really do. This is what people are saying:   I'm really taken with Locale. [...] The idea that I have an intelligent phone that configures itself depending on where I am is very powerful.  - Fred Wilson, principal of Union Square Ventures   Locale has a lot going for it. It's easy to use, but has some advanced functionality under the hood. We have found the battery usage to be absolutely amazing.

ANDROID_TOOL;Universal Unroot will Unroot ANY Android powered device that is already Rooted and has a form of Superuser installed (Android OS Version 4.2.2 and below as of 7/24/2013). Samsung Galaxy devices from 2013 and onward are unlikely to work correctly. Examples are Galaxy Note 10.1, Galaxy MEGA, Galaxy S 4, Galaxy Note 2, and Galaxy Note 3. This is because of KNOX.  LG devices will be fully unrooted, but will still say  Rooted  afterwards because of LG's eFuse.   Simply hit the 'UNROOT' button and allow Root Access when asked to give it permission. The device will then reboot and you will be completely Unrooted when you boot back up.  ****WHEN APP DOES NOT REBOOT AFTER ALLOWING ROOT, CLOSE THE APP AND HIT UNROOT AGAIN****  This is a great app for those who are trying to complete a warranty return with a carrier for a defective device hardware or a repair. If you only want to temporarily lose Root Access, this app is not for you. Unrooting is permanent and cannot be undone with this app. Only use this if you truly want to lose Root Access.  If your device has an Insecure Kernel (Boot.img) the app will now tell you and close. This is for users who could not bother to read the App Description that warns you that if your device has an Insecure Kernel, it will NOT fully unroot you.   Insecure Kernel (Boot.img) means that unless your Kernel (Boot.img) is brought back to the factory stock file, your device will never be unrooted fully, so this app will no longer bother attempting to try, only to get users complaining about not being able to OTA.  Please be aware, this app does not gurantee that it will fix your specific devices  Over-The-Air Update  issues. In most cases, anything you did with root such as: Debloating, Installing a custom Kernel, custom ROM, custom Recovery (like TWRP or Clockworkmod), enabling tether, etc. will NOT be un-done by this app. If you can't update because your system was modified, look for a way to flash back the entire device, such as Odin for Samsung. You can see a video explaining this by  zedomaxx  on youtube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdlIxE7K_vw  Support for x86, ARM, and MIPS devices. Support for ChainsDD Superuser, Chainfire SuperSu, and Koush Superuser.

ANDROID_TOOL;The original custom auto brightness solution for Android.   To put it simply, Lux kicks the pants off of Android?Î∏s stock brightness manager, and it?Î∏s worth every cent.  - Lifehacker   Lux is a third-party app that allows you to easily calibrate your phone?Î∏s brightness sensor, saving you battery power and reducing eye strain if your phone is normally too bright in dark rooms.  - HowToGeek   Lux isn't your ordinary brightness app. It intelligently adjusts the brightness of your display based on the environment you're in. If you step into a dimly lit room, Lux will automatically lower the brightness of your display to make it not only comfortable to read, but to also preserve battery power.   Lux is also able to adjust the screen temperature of your display automatically to make it appropriate for night usage. At sunset, you can have Lux automatically warm your display and switch to your Night profile. If you're an astronomer, you can enable astronomer mode to cut out harsh white light. If you have a root enabled phone, you may even be able to apply these enhancements at a low level with Lux's plug-in system.   Perhaps the best thing about Lux is that you can teach it how to behave. If the backlight is too bright or dim for your liking, simply open the provided Dashboard, adjust the brightness slider to the level you desire, then hold the link button. Lux will use this new 'link' as a reference in future.   Give it a go! I want you to test Lux for more than the 15 minute refund period offered by Google. I understand that some devices may not have the best quality light sensor, and that you may need more time to play around with settings. If you find that Lux doesn't suit you after the 15 minutes is up, you can request a refund within a week of purchase via e-mail - no questions asked.    ?ˆêFEATURES?ˆê ?—® Stable, custom auto brightness with root plug-in support. ?—® Use your ambient light sensor or camera(s) to read in ambient light. ?—® Subzero brightness for night viewing. ?—® Select between Auto, Day, Night, Car and Cinema light profiles ?—® Automatic night mode. Change the colour temperature of your display for comfortable night time viewing. ?—® Astronomer mode. Adds a red filter to your display to preserve the eyesight of stargazers. ?—® Power-user settings such as choice of interpolation, filters, and linked sample editing. ?—® Add app specific exceptions via sleep mode. ?—® Customisable fade for backlight adjustments. ?—® Tasker and Locale support ?—® Battery efficient. ?—® Backup to SD. ?—® No ads or other nuisances.

DRAW OVER OTHER APPS: Required for night/astro mode.  READ PHONE STATE: Required to prevent Lux from interfering with phone controls in Android 4.1.  MODIFY SYSTEM SETTINGS: Brightness is a system setting, as is toggling the default auto brightness.

Thanks for your support!**  What the Press Are Saying:  GamesRadar  As a complete package, Star Wars Pinball delivers the kind of arcade experience that makes you crave just one more game, constantly chasing to surpass your own score for the sheer satisfaction of it.   Desctructoid - 9.5/10  Each table is chock full of beautiful art, character cameos, and tracks pulled straight from the films' soundtracks. These first three tables are a bold and equally stellar introduction to Star Wars Pinball, and they'll keep you more than busy until Zen Studios drops the next batch.   Game Informer - 8.5/10  You don't need to be a Star Wars fan to recognize the creativity Zen has brought to the new tables. The company continues to include more fantasy elements in its designs.   CNET - 8.9/10 The best thing about Star Wars Pinball is its jaw-dropping graphics. The many targets, ramps, rollovers, and kickers that make up its pinball course are all polished with incredible detail. Even the pinball itself is stunning, with its metallic surface realistically reflecting the ambient lights as it spins across the table. And the choreographed flashing of all these table elements really make you feel as though Zen Studios pulled out all the stops when making this game.  Penny Arcade Report (Ben Kuchera)  If you?Î∏re a fan of pinball, Star Wars, or fun things, this is pretty much a must-purchase.   ### Be sure to visit us at www.zenpinball.com.

USE_INTERNET;"Do you want to stream all your Logitech Squeezebox content directly to your Android Device? Then SqueezePlayer is your perfect match - it turns your Android phone or tablet into a SqueezeBox on its own!  You won't even need a Logitech Squeezebox to make SqueezePlayer work - just download the (free) Squeezebox-Server (see below) ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Stream your Music via WiFi or Mobile Connection ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Make your music free! Now you can take all your music with you - car, school, work, garden, anywhere in your house.  SqueezePlayer is able to stream your local music (see below for supported formats), internet radio stations or songs from Apps like Last.FM, Deezer or WiMP from your Squeezebox-Server directly to your mobile or tablet. (Rhapsody and Pandora NOT working right now, due to licensing issues, Spotify only works with the help of triodes plugin installed in a Squeezebox-Server, Napster only works with Windows-based server).  For playback to be working via 3G you will need to open/forward port 9000 and 3483 on your router (as well as setting up a DynDNS service). As networking/streaming from your home network via internet is not straightforward, please also visit my growing tutorial: http://www.squeezeplayer.com/2011/05/how-to-connect-via-3g/  SqueezePlayer is a playback App - you won't be able to control your Squeezebox (nor itself) with it. But there are enough Apps out there being a perfect fit: OrangeSqueeze, SqueezeCommander, Squeeze Control or free alternatives like the official Logitech App, Squeezer or SqueezeDroid.  From the main screen of SqueezePlayer you can jump directly to any of these App, where you mobile will be among all other players as long as SqueezePlayer is activated. In OrangeSqueeze this also works the other way round: it will start SqueezePlayer automatically from the players list, so here it is highly integrated.  By the way: if you have any problem with SqueezePlayer, please contact me! I'm very happy to help you sort all problems out: support(at)squeezeplayer.com  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Supported Music Formats ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê  SqueezePlayer can stream FLAC, MP3, WAV and PCM natively (i.e. these are decoded directly on your Android Device)  Your SqueezeboxServer will be able to convert other file types (Ogg, mp4) to FLAC or mp3 on the fly, so these will play as well. (You can check the settings screen of your Squeezebox Server under Advanced-&gt;File Types what other file types will be transcoded to FLAC or mp3).  Please note that the inbuilt server of the Touch will not be able to transcode as much as a real server, you will be bound to the natively support formats!  ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê Requirements ?ˆê?ˆê?ˆê For SqueezePlayer to work you need to set up the Logitech Squeezebox Server (recently renamed to  Logitech Media Server ).  You can download it here: http://downloads.slimdevices.com/LogitechMediaServer_v7.7.1/ SqueezePlayer will also work with the integrated server of the Squeezebox Touch (but be aware, that this one cannot convert as many formats as a real server).

USE_INTERNET;Mobile ODIN is the on-device firmware flasher of choice. Just throw those firmware files on your (internal or external) SD card, start Mobile ODIN and flash away. !

For discussion and support: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1347899  - MANUAL -  Flashing with Mobile ODIN is easy. You start by starting the app and the app will check your system has everything it needs to continue (like root). It may need to download an additional package, so it is advised you have Wi-Fi available.  Now you should see the main Mobile ODIN screen. It will list a set of partitions. Clicking a partition will allow you to select a file from your SD card to flash to that partition. Do not worry about selecting the wrong file - Mobile ODIN will not let you. Separate files (named after the partition) as well as .tar and .tar.md5 files are supported.  From the desktop ODIN you may be used to  PDA ,  PHONE , and  CSC  buttons. All three of these buttons have been replaced by the  Open file ...  button. This button will open the file you select from the SD card, and find all the partitions it can flash inside that file. So if you select a .tar file containing kernel and modem, the Kernel and Modem partitions will be set up to use that .tar file for flashing.  Now that we have selected what we want to flash, if you have the Pro version you can proceed to the EverRoot section. The EverRoot options allows you to root your firmware while it is being flashed. Never again will you be without root! Select here which apps you want to inject in the firmware that is being flashed.  Now that we are all done selecting partitions and configuring EverRoot, we continue to  Flash firmware . Mobile ODIN will gather all the information it needs and perform the flash. Before starting, however, it will check that your battery level is over 50%, and if applicable offer to verify MD5 checksums on the files you have selected to flash. If all is well, it will reboot into recovery mode, and flash the firmware you have selected.  
ANDROID_TOOL;"SuperSU is the Superuser access management tool of the future ;) !!! SuperSU requires a rooted device !!!  SuperSU allows for advanced management of Superuser access rights for all the apps on your device that need root. SuperSU has been built from the ground up to counter a number of problems with other Superuser access management tools.   Features include:  - Superuser access prompt - Superuser access logging - Superuser access notifications - Per-app notification configuration - Temporary unroot - Deep process detection (no more unknowns) - Works in recovery (no more segfaulting) - Works when Android isn't properly booted - Works with non-standard shell locations - Always runs in ghost mode - Wake on prompt - Convert to /system app - Complete unroot - Backup script to survive CyanogenMod nightlies - Icon selectable from 5 options + invisible - Theme selectable from 4 options - Launch from dialer: *#*#1234#*#* or *#*#7873778#*#* (*#*#SUPERSU#*#*) NOTE: Not all phones take both codes. On some phones you need to use single *# instead of double *#*#  The Pro version additionally offers:  - OTA survival mode (no guarantees) - Full color-coded command content logging (input/output/error) - Per-app logging configuration - Per-app user override - Grant/deny root to an app for a set amount of time - PIN protection - Per-app PIN protection - Adjust auto-deny countdown   The discussion and support thread can be found on XDA-Developers here:  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1538053   SUPERUSER This is meant to replace Superuser (if installed), you use either one or the other. You cannot combine them. Statements that this breaks Superuser are therefore completely nonsensical.   NOTICE: A SPECIAL PROCEDURE IS NEEDED FOR UNINSTALLATION. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE APP, DO *NOT* JUST UNINSTALL IT, YOU *WILL* LOSE ROOT.   Superuser access management runs through a so called  su binary . There can be only one of these at a time. So if you install SuperSU, your previous superuser access management solution will no longer operate. So if you want to switch back: (1) Open that application, and search for an option for it to install/update/replace the  su binary . (2) Confirm root-using apps are using the superuser solution you want. (3) Uninstall SuperSU.   TRANSLATIONS Want to help translate SuperSU ? See http://www.getlocalization.com/supersu/ !  "
ANDROID_TOOL;!!! This is a license file for SuperSU. This is NOT a stand-alone app. You need SuperSU already installed. Reboot after installation !!! SuperSU Pro adds the following features to your SuperSU installation:  - OTA survival mode (no guarantees) - Full color-coded command content logging (input/output/error) - Per-app logging configuration - Per-app user override - PIN protection  See the SuperSU app description for further details on SuperSU.  Note that SuperSU Pro is rarely updated - most of the updated code goes directly into the main SuperSU app. That is the one you need to update.  
ANDROID_TOOL;Many Samsung devices store a flash counter that keeps track of how many times you have flashed *custom* firmwares to your device. On some devices, a yellow triangle or other sort of visual warning is also displayed during boot if you are running a *custom* firmware. TriangleAway was built to disable the triangle (if a visual warning is present) and reset the custom ROM flash counter to 0. This app requires root ! You can find out the current status of your flash counter and firmware state (custom or official) by booting into  download mode  on most devices. The usual way of getting into  download mode  is by first turning off your device, then turning it on by pressing and holding VolDown+(Home)+Power. Alternatively, the  adb reboot download  command also often works.  When you run TriangleAway, if your device and firmware are supported, it will show you the detected state of the binary (custom or official) and flash counter value, and the option to  Reset flash counter . Please confirm that the information shown is correct before resetting the values.  On a number of devices, TriangleAway can work, but your firmware may not be supported directly. In that case, the app will tell you it needs to reboot into a special boot mode, which will be happen if you select  Reset flash counter . The device will reboot into a special mode which will allow you to review the current status and reset the binary and flash counter values (or abort and do nothing). On some devices this will actually trigger the counter to 1 if its 0 - so if you're  just checking , do that in download mode!  !!! THIS IS A DANGEROUS OPERATION AND COULD POTENTIALLY BRICK YOUR DEVICE. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK. A USB JIG IS PREFERRED IF YOU HAVE A WORKING ONE !!! ( and by brick I mean brick - only a board replacement or a JTAG unit will be able to save you, don't mess with boot(loader) stuff unless you *really* mean it! )  Note#1: using Triangle Away may unmount your SD card. Reboot or manually remount it from Android settings.  Note#2: on new devices status can only be reset on stock firmwares!

Whether or not Triangle Away works may depend on your kernel, try flashing a different one if it doesn't work.  Please also note that some devices set the counter to 1 at every boot if you are running a custom kernel or recovery. On these devices, Triangle Away may always display 1 - make sure to check the counter in actual download mode.

Canabalt represents the power and potential of small independent games.  -gameinmind.com   Music is another component that is just perfect - it enhances the strange and unsettling setting of the game and also gives a sense of speed with a hint of hope that quick feet might be the salvation to the horror.  -bartsnews.net   Fast load times combined with short (yet exciting) game sessions really make for an attractive game to play on a mobile device.  -TouchArcade

Features: - 1x1, 2x1 and 1x2 tiles with configurable colors - Widgets in a tile! (provided that widget fits) - Almost real like tile animation - Almost real like tile re-arrange mode - Almost real like status bar - Animated contacts tile (supports G+ synced contacts) - Pinnable contact-tile which animates like the real phone - Folder tiles - Webpage tiles - Picture hub (use with care, it needs memory!!!!) - Filterable application list - Stock wp7-like colors and color selection  FAQ: - Full tile bitmaps are no more! Normal tiles can now have background image which does the same thing - and you can now have both icon and background on a tile! - Real view widget tiles may cause jerky scrolling, framework is performing garbage collection at most inconvenient time, there is currently no known cure.. I haven't yet given up hope finding one though - PICTURE HUB NEEDS A LOT OF MEMORY!

GAME; Poop Rearing Simulator  is a simulation game that offers you a real-time poop rearing experience. This game was originally released as the world's first poop rearing software in 1998 and has been continuously made improvements. Now the game gained world recognition and became a top-ranked poop rearing software amongst many rival games. The latest version 5.x finally adds support for mobile devices and allows you to take care of your poop anytime and anywhere, as well as having an intuitive touch interface makes it possible to better interact with the poop directly.  Take care of your poop on your smartphone or tablet right now!  ---------------- Overview ----------------  - The birth of Poop  The first time you launch the software, it will prompt you to enter the name of your poop. Name your poop and tap  OK , then your poop will appear on the screen (the screen may appear darker and the images could be difficult to see during the night). Your poop is now born.   - Poop is alive  The poop is alive. It has 365 days a year just like us. Even though you exit the software, your poop grows up. (Don't worry, it won't consume any battery when off). Raise your poop with constant love and attention: it will grow up and improve physical abilities.  - Feed Poop  The most basic method of rearing a poop is to feed a meal. Select a meal from the Feeding menu at the bottom of the screen and bring it to the center of your poop. As you successfully feed your poop, it will be satisfied. The poop is influenced by what it eats, so make sure you feed it balanced meals. If your poop shapes a curlicue poo after several meals, it means your poop is full. Feed it 3 to 5 times a day.  - Communicate with Poop  You can communicate with your poop by touching it. Don't leave it alone for a long time, otherwise it feels lonely. You can shape your poop by touching it, turning or pulling it up and down. The poop feels happy when you touch it. However, touching it too much could prevent its growth.  Tap the poop to poke it. Poking makes it happy but don't do it too much. It will get angry.  - Keep Poop Indoor  The poop stays outside at first but you can also keep it indoor. Select indoor from the Environment menu to move it indoor. It is healthier to keep the poop outside, however it is safer to keep it indoor as you can avoid weather changes.  - Observe Poop  Raise your poop properly otherwise it may feel lonely or get sick without even noticing. Select Observe from the Observe menu to check the condition of your poop from time to time.  Tap photo on the Observe menu to take a picture. It is also fun to record stages of your poop's growth. The pictures will be stored in the Unko folder of the external memory, and you can view them later by using an image viewing application such as Android Gallery.  - Train Poop  When you get used to raise the poop, teach your poop tricks. In order to train your poop, first input a specific gesture that you want to teach around the poop. Even a newborn poop can learn tricks like a lateral move or spin.  [Gestures] Lateral move: Flick right or left Spin: Rub right and left  * The poop can learn the following moves as it grows up. Keep an eye on it as it achieves a new gesture.  Jump: Double tap Zoom out: Long tap Zoom in: Rub the screen widely Wiggle: Rub up and down Handstand: Flick down Stretch: Flick up  Specify a trick and tap around the poop. This is the sign to start the trick. The more you practice, the better your poop can be. If you a have trouble to teach it tricks, it could be a good idea to ask other owners. Your poop can do more than you can imagine. Input multiple gestures and tap or insert one trick after another. Your poop will show you combination tricks or splendid continuous tricks. You will build up ties with your poop before your poop can do acrobatic tricks.

GAME;Raise your dog to beat the best!  AN APP THAT WILL NEVER APPEAR IN THE iPHONE APP STORE! The Controversial Dogfighting Android  DogWars - Beta  app by Kage Games LLC has been renamed to KG Dogfighting!  Feed, water, train and FIGHT your virtual pet dog against others...  -Interactive action training games -Chatroom -Many characters and dogs to choose from -Virtual store (training gear, weapons, guns, steroids, bling) -Shoot outs with the 'authorities' trying to catch you for dogfighting  This game is more fun than MMORPGs like iMobsters or gangwars, because it has action games of skill utilizing the touchscreen for swiping gestures like papertoss or angry birds, and the accelerometer like many racing games and crazy snowboarder. There is no sex, nudity, or naked girls, but it is an adult multiplayer game that could have swear words from other users and offensive material. It has kind of a ghetto, hood rat type feel with rap theme music.  NO PITBULLS WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS APP... a few flies got swatted. YOU MUST BE 13 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY.  Drop your cred codes and ideas in the comments section or message boards on the web. Check the shoutbox in the game for news and game updates, or just talk fight and smack with other players.  If you get a bug, please send us the report or email us.  PLEASE REMEMBER: 1. It is just A VIDEO GAME 2. Perhaps one day we will make gerbil wars or betta fish wars for people who can't understand fantasy role play games 3. Just because something is illegal in real life in certain countries, does not mean it is illegal to make a song, movie, or video game about it 4. Just go slingshot some virtual birds to kill some virtual pigs. 5. Go complain to someone who cares about Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Weed Farmer, Smoke a Bowl and maybe even Sierra's Leisure Suit Larry from 1987. (We heard it is actually coming to Android soon!) 6. This is listed as a HIGH MATURITY app, and does NOT violate the Terms of Use with the Google market in any way!!!  Let's Get it On!  Developer Note: We appreciate everyone's thoughts about our app as we are firm believers in the right to free speech and the free exchange of ideas.  These freedoms are the building blocks of the Google Android operating system and the very reason so many users choose Google Android over the alternative.  We've heard thoughts from many dog and animal lovers about our app and first we, as dog owners and dog lovers ourselves, would like to thank you for your thoughts and for the work many of you do on behalf of our canine friends. We DO NOT CONDONE violence towards animals or humans, and we are confident in humankind's ability to distinguish between a rudimentary game and the consequences of real life.  We are confident this game will be a net benefit to dogs as it has been in our operating agreement from the start of this project that a portion of the proceeds go to animal rescue organizations. Further, this is a satire about the ridiculousness of dogfighting and we believe in the power of a modern media tool to educate and raise awareness of the real horrors. Another portion of our proceeds are also being appropriated for catastrophic human tragedies, the first of which is the Japan Tsunami relief effort. We encourage everyone to donate to BOTH of these very important causes.  There are hundreds of games on the Google Android market as well as any other popular game platform which, if acted out in real life, would be illegal. What makes the Google Android platform special is it gives the freedom and responsibility to the individual users to decide what to put on their phones as opposed to the phone carriers and app stores making value judgments on our behalf.  Lastly, we are incorporating suggestions from both our supporters and our detractors in an effort to create a more socially conscious app that provides a net benefit to dogs as well as humans. Please remember that censorship is a very slippery slope.  
GAME;"SPECIAL PRICE 50% OFF(USD 9.99 -&gt; USD 4.99)!!! A brand new entry in the Alphadia series! Full-fledged fantasy RPG experience with stunning 3D battles!  NEW RPG RELEASES EVERY MONTH!! SEE MORE!!!  *Important Notice* Due to high memory usage, it is not recommended to run multiple applications simultaneously in the background while playing the game. Doing so could cause loading failure or force quit. Please free up any available memory before playing.   Alphadia Genesis boasts a rich multifaceted story that revolves around Fray, an Archleign's guild member and Corone, a knight in the Ghalzabine Army. As their journey progresses and conflicting national interests come to the forefront, it becomes apparent that it will take more than a little work on both their parts if their relationship is to weather the boding storm on the horizon.  Having been at peace for only 15 years since the end of the Energi War, the kingdoms of Archleign and Ghalzabine are once again thrust onto center stage after a murder perpetrated by a clone, whose rights and freedoms they both lobbied for, comes to light. Hoping the treaty signed to end the use of clones for conventional warfare has not been violated, a joint-investigative team is put together to find out the cause and bring those responsible to justice. However, things then appear to be far more volatile than anyone could have first imagined...   Dramatic Event Scenes With a voice cast of many notable Japanese actors and actresses lending their talents to the story, significant events take on more meaning as each has life breathed into them, allowing players to become more deeply immersed in the world.   Intense 3D Battles Shifting camera angles and voiced characters are just a few of the new features that make battles more engaging than ever before! And with beautifully rendered graphics and vibrant Energi and Break Skills, players will never tire of being bloated with such a visual feast! Furthermore, with the inclusion of a highly efficient auto-battle function, portable gaming has never been this convenient! Not to be forgotten, however, roaming the land are monsters so powerful that if come upon unprepared, players will face certain doom!   Energi In the world of Lagoon, there are three elementals from which all Energi flows- fire, water, and light. Learning to harness these forces will allow the player to become more adept in skills related to them, which include attack, recovery, and support. Therefore, it would be wise to become acquainted with their use as early on in the game as possible.   Submembers Characters outside the battle party can cooperate in various ways through the use of Assists. Depending on the combination of submembers, attack, defense and other parameters like the critical rate can be increased. Moreover, when the Assist Gauge has been maxed out, powerful combo attacks can be unleashed with their help.  *While in-app-purchase content requires additional fees, by no means it is necessary for finishing the game. *The actual price might differ depending on the region.

This rangefinder(telemeter) measures the Distance, Height, Width and Area of a target with your phone by trigonometry.  Usage is simple: just stand up and press the shutter. The important point is aiming the camera at the GROUND, NOT the object. (i.e. In order to measure the distance from someone, aim at his shoes.)  If it is inaccurate, please read the instructions in this app or see the checklist diagram in the blog. The sensors on your phone can be changed by OS version, firmware and battery status.

DOCUMENT_EDITOR;Sound Level Meter is in the 4th set of the Smart Tools collection (noise, decibel meter). SPL(sound pressure level) meter app uses your built-in microphone to measure noise volume in decibels(db), and shows a reference. We had calibrated many android devices with the actual sound level meter with dB(A).  REMEMBER!! The built-in microphones were aligned to human voice (300-3400Hz, 40-60dB). Therefore the maximum values are LIMITED by the hardware limitation, and very loud sound(100+ db) cannot be recognized. Moto Droid (max.100), Galaxy S3 (81dB), Galaxy Note (91dB), Galaxy S2 (98dB)...  See the 4-6th pictures. I had calibrated many android devices with an actual sound level meter. You can trust the result in routine-noise levels (40-70dB). But, please use it as an auxiliary tool.   * Pro version added Features : - Sound Meter and Vibrometer are integrated - Statistic menu with saving log data - CSV file exporting - Level notification - Line-chart duration - More models are calibrated - No ads  * Do you want more tools? Get [Sound Meter Pro] and [Smart Tools] package.  For more information, see the manual, Youtube video and the blog.

GAME;Have you ever wondered what it?Î∏s like to land the Space Shuttle? Now you can find out. F-Sim Space Shuttle is a critically acclaimed flight simulator for Android smartphones and tablets. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy. We?Î∏ve tried to combine realistic flight dynamics with stunning graphics and fun game play: Each landing attempt takes just a few minutes. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again. Each flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. Landing the Orbiter takes practice, but the built-in autopilot demo and tutorials will get you started. After your first safe touchdown, chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different weather conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles.   You control the Orbiter?Î∏s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we?Î∏ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they?Î∏ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it?Î∏s your turn to give it a try.  Here?Î∏s what others have said about it:  ?Î“Because this app is so visually exciting, so technically deep, so sophisticated, so beautifully done in its realism, effects, and documentation, it earned a perfect 5/5 rating, Outstanding.?Îú John Martellaro, Senior Editor for Reviews, The Mac Observer  ?Î“I was excited to see that I can enjoy flying the space shuttle realistically also on my iPhone and complement my addiction to our Space Shuttle Mission Simulator on PC when I am on the road.?Îú Alex L., www.space-shuttle-mission.com  ?Î“Absolutely awesome app that is a must for shuttle huggers and aspiring astronauts.?Îú Chris Bergin, Managing Editor, NASASpaceflight.com

WIDGET;ON JELLY BEAN, THIS APPLICATION CANNOT USE ORIGINAL MINECRAFT TEXTURES WITHOUT ROOT ACCESS! A built-in texture pack is provided for those without root.  THIS APPLICATION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH SOME SAMSUNG DEVICES! Devices with Samsung Knox or other security solutions may not be able to utilize the live patching and the ModPE Script Runtime of BlockLauncher. Patching .mod-formatted patches and texture packs still work. A fix is being worked on. BlockLauncher Pro is a custom Minecraft Pocket Edition launcher that wraps around Minecraft PE and provides loading of patches, texture packs, and server IPs. (formerly known as MCPELauncher)  THIS APPLICATION MAY NOT WORK ON ALL DEVICES! Please try the free version before buying this version to make sure that the app is compatible.  Just choose Options on the main screen, then select mods. It is that easy!  This program loads libminecraftpe.so from the currently installed copy of Minecraft PE, so it should be compatiable with the mod patching features of PocketTool and QuickPatch.  Jelly Bean users: currently, this application cannot load original textures from copies of Minecraft installed by Google Play on Android 4.1 and above. The built-in texture pack will be used if no texture pack is selected.

ANDROID_TOOL;SystemPanel integrates a task manager, app manager (installer/uninstaller with multi-version APK archival), and system monitor. Solve your battery life problem by enabling the background monitoring service to record long-term CPU usage by individual apps.  SystemPanel includes the following features:  Task Manager: The task manager shows what applications are currently loaded into memory and/or running on a device, including current CPU and memory utilization for each. The task manager provides the ability to kill offending applications, and includes an emergency  end all  widget to handle extreme scenarios.  System Monitor: The system monitor can be enabled to record device usage history over a period of time (up to one week), such that you can determine what applications and usage patterns have the greatest impact on battery life. This feature is commonly used to help track down which applications are having major negative effects on battery life. The system monitor records CPU usage for each process, overall CPU usage, display usage, battery level, and battery charging status.  Installer: The installer enables you to install and uninstall applications quickly and conveniently. It can archive multiple versions of applications, such that you can backup your apps before an update and revert back to older versions afterward. This is useful in the not uncommon event the updated item is buggy or otherwise undesirable. Additionally, the Installer is designed to work much more efficiently than the standard Android application manager, and does not suffer the frustrating lag issues found in the default Android item when browsing through a large number of installed apps.  Device Information: The device information screens show detailed information about your Android device, including storage, capabilities, network state, and OS build information.  -- Frequently Asked Questions --  Why does it require the ______ permission?  - SystemPanel does require a fair number of permissions in order to be able to perform all of its duties. This product DOES NOT send ANY information from your device over the Internet to ANYONE. It requires the  Internet access  and  telephony/read phone state  permissions only to monitor and display the device's network connectivity state. A full description of why each permission is required can be found in the SystemPanel FAQ on our web site.  Does SystemPanel consume battery? - The only component of SystemPanel which runs in the background is the  System Monitor  feature. This feature must be enabled by the user (by default, SystemPanel runs nothing in the background). When enabled, the System Monitor feature will record data about which applications are consuming the battery every 15 minutes. All told, this feature will use approximately one minute of CPU / battery time per day of operation. When this feature is not enabled, SystemPanel will not run in the background in any capacity.  Does SystemPanel automatically kill tasks in the background? - No, SystemPanel is not an automatic task killer. It has been well-established (by the Android documentation and direct communication with the Android engineers) that randomly or periodically terminating arbitrary tasks in the interest of saving memory will NOT yield a benefit in performance or battery life. The only benefit you will see from an automatic task killer is if it happens to terminate misbehaving apps. SystemPanel provides a better solution to this problem by showing you which apps are consuming CPU in the background (over time) with the  System Monitor  feature. It is then recommended that such applications be reconfigured or uninstalled (or perhaps corrected by filing a bug with the offending application's author).  A much more extensive FAQ is available on our web site.  Please visit our web site at http://android.nextapp.com for more information, including a complete screenshot tour of the product.
